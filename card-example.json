See his book, <i>The Invisible Universe</i>, where he emphasizes how astronomers initially considered radio waves from space either a hoax or a mistake.  His book, <i>Interstellar Matters</i>, contains a couple of chapters which in great detail explain how to read a radio astronomy paper.  With not much more than that, Verschuur's numerous IEEE papers will become accessible to most laypeople.  His papers on interstellar HI hydrogen and critical ionization velocities (CIV's) are particularly noteworthy because they appear to suggest that ionization is an ongoing process in space -- directly contradicting what is taught to astrophysicists today.  Verschuur frequently questions the use of the term 'cloud' to describe the interstellar matter structures, due to its unusually filamentary nature.  Although his publications do not directly raise the question of electricity in space (due to ongoing resistance to the idea amongst peer reviewers), it is clear to many that he is entertaining the notion."

From wikipedia: 'The Fermi paradox — or Fermi's paradox — is the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, such as in the Drake equation, and the lack of evidence for such civilizations.'  Wal's approach would neatly explain the paradox because electromagnetic communications are commonly obstructed by plasma double layers like our own ionosphere.  In the configuration proposed, the planet would be deeply embedded within the star's electromagnetic envelope -- hence we'd struggle to observe these radio signals.  The whole idea might sound like a wacky, unsupported claim, but in fact, Dwardu Cardona has published a number of excellent books which dedicate a few thousand pages filled with references to supporting these claims.  I cannot recommend enough Dwardu's books."

These are morphologies (shapes) that electricity takes when it is conducted over gas (more properly termed plasma) at extremely high charge densities.  If you look carefully at the last morphology, the central ring is the source of what is called synchrotron radiation.  Peratt explains that this would have been very dangerous radiation.  The 2d squatter man drawing appears to follow from the luminosity which results from viewing the 3d form edge-wise."
