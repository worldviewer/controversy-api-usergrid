On the other hand, there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of publications by dendrochronologists implicitly claiming that they do understand the biology of wood formation, as they have used their data to imagine when past regimes of water, temperature, pollutants, CO2, soil nutrients, and so forth existed. Note that all of the counts and measurements on tree rings in the world cannot substantiate anything unequivocally; they are merely observations.

It has therefore been surmised that before these fallen denizens of the forests had time to decompose, they were covered by the waters of the swamps in which they had thrived.  But then we find deposits of sand above coal seams which indicate a sedimentary layer that had somehow covered the coal-forming remains.  And because other coal seams are found on top of this sandy deposit, it has been reasoned that the sand acted as the soil on which a new forest grew and thrived before it, too, suffered the same fate as the previous one.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMarine fossils are often found embedded in the layers between coal seams\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [1].  An incursion of the sea is then blamed for these deposits but, because coal was then again formed on top of them, the sea must again have retreated.  \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe problem here is that in certain areas as much as 400 coal seams have been found interspersed between other layers of sedimentation.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e  This, then, would mean that the sea must have inundated the land and again retreated that many times.

This is lent credibility by the fact that various forests covering thousands of acreage, and calculated to be something like 70,000 years old, have been discovered buried in the peat of the British Fenlands, including Scotland and Ireland.

They often hinge their current arguments on the occurrence of upright trees in Yellowstone National Park, point to their volcanic setting, and then point to floating upright trees floating in Spirit Lake near Mt. St. Helens [2], and say, &#39;See? They could be transported during the flood.&#39;.

This is not the correct way to do it, because individual beds can be deposited rapidly (say, sands and mud during a levee breach), and then little deposition can occur for a long time (e.g., a soil horizon), as is observed in modern river floodplain environments where trees commonly occur.

An underclay is technically the bed of clay which underlies a coal-seam; but it has now become a general term for a fossil soil, or a bed which once formed a terrestrial surface, and supported trees and other plants; because we generally find these coal underclays, like the subsoils of many modern peat-bogs, to contain roots and trunks of trees which aided in the accumulation of the vegetable matter of the coal. The underclays in question are accordingly penetrated by innumerable long rootlets, now in a coaly state, but retaining enough of their form to enable us to recognise them as belonging to a peculiar root, the Stigmaria, of very frequent occurrence in the coal measures, and at one time supposed to have been a swamp plant of anomalous form, but now known to have belonged to an equally singular tree, the Sigillaria, found in the same deposits (Fig. 30). The Sigillaria has derived its name from the regularly arranged pits or spots left by its rootlets, which proceeded from it on all sides. The Sigillaria has been named from the rows of leaf-scars which extend up its trunk, which in some species is curiously ribbed or fluted. One of the most remarkable peculiarities of the stigmaria-rooted trees was the very regular arrangement of their roots, which are four at their departure from the trunk, and divide at equal distances successively into eight, sixteen, and thirty-two branches, each giving off, on all sides, an immense number of rootlets, stretching into the beds around, in a manner which shows that these must have been soft sand and mud at the time when these roots and rootlets spread through them.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt is evident that when we find a bed of clay now hardened into stone, and \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003econtaining the roots and rootlets of these plants in their natural position\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, we can infer, 1st, that such beds must once have been in a very soft condition; 2dly, that \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethe roots found in them were not drifted, but grew in their present positions\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e; in short, that these ancient roots are in similar circumstances with those of the recent trees that underlie the Amherst marshes.

According to Dr. John Calder, this interpretation is &#39;too restrictive&#39; and others (such as myself) believe that this view is incorrect.  One of the first things which led me to question this interpretation were the drawings themselves.  It seemed strange to suggest that many of the fossil trees have &#39;extensive root systems&#39; yet the pictures and drawings of them do not.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe term polystrate fossil [1] is now often used to describe fossil trees that are upright in relation to the surrounding strata.  Such trees quite often traverse multiple layers of horizontally deposited strata: including sandstones, shales, and sometimes even coal seams. [2]  Upright fossil plants range in size from small rootlets, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eto trees over 80 feet long\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e. [3]  Nova Scotia, has perhaps more upright fossil trees and plants than any place on earth.  At Joggins alone, erect trees and plants occur at over 50 &#39;levels&#39; scattered throughout 7,500 feet of strata; erect roots and rootlets occur at many more levels.  Drifted plants and trees also occur in many sections of this strata.  These drift deposits are scattered over more than 10,000 vertical feet of strata. [4, 5, 6]  \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMost of the upright fossil trees at Joggins are from 2-15 feet in length.  The longest was 40 feet. [7]  Many, if not most, of the upright fossil trees at Joggins have little or no visible traces of roots. [8]  In addition, many of the larger Stigmaria roots are  missing their rootlets and many, if not most, rootlets are buried individually: unattached to any tree, or larger root.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [8, 9]  Fragile fossils such as leaves are also common in the Joggins and Sidney strata. [10]  Animal tracks, insects, and rain marks are also found, although they are not nearly as common.  The strata at Sydney is also said to be very similar to that of Joggins.

In 1949, James Arnold and Willard Libby published a &#39;curve of knowns&#39; which was a test of the technique, and therefore of the assumption of constant concentration, using known-age samples ranging from about 900 to 4900 years old.

It therefore became clear that radiocarbon results would need to be calibrated to convert them to calendar ages.  Since there is no theoretical way of predicting the correction factor, empirical calibration curves were needed to link radiocarbon &#39;age&#39; with known age.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the 1960s, a continuous tree-ring sequence stretching back some 8000 years was established by Wesley Ferguson, and the first calibration curve using this was published by Hans Suess.  \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis curve was partly based on a remarkable tree, the bristlecone pine\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e ...\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSuess&#39;s curve confirmed that there are indeed major discrepancies between radiocarbon age and calendar age.

First there is a long-term trend that can be described approximately by a sine wave with a period of about 9000 years.  The maximum deviation from true age is about 900 years too recent at the beginning of the fourth millenium BC.

Suess, when asked about the line drawn through his data points, said he had used the process of &#39;cosmic schwung&#39;, what we might call &#39;freehand&#39;.  Whether these wiggles really existed or were an artefact of experimental error was the subject of much investigation in the 1970s.

The growth lines vary in spacing from a few microns to nearly zero, and it is often difficult to decide whether one should be counted or not. Under these circumstances, it is notorious that total counts come out at what the investigators think they should be. The subjectiveness of such counts is highlighted by a report by R. G. Hipkin, an Edinburgh University geophysicist, that he counted 253 ridges and later 359 ridges in a repeat count of the same specimen.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [29]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn order to remove all doubt about the validity of radiocarbon dating, Stiebing informs us that\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;rejection of radiocarbon dating also means rejection of dendrochronology (tree ring dating), \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eone of the most accurate dating methods yet developed.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e A tree ring sequence 7,000 years long has been developed from the long-lived bristlecone pine tree of the southwestern United States ... More recently, a 6,000-year tree ring sequence developed from Irish Oak trees has been radiocarbon tested and its calibration curve generally agrees with that established from the bristlecone sequence. Both sets of calibrated dates generally support the conventional chronology for ancient Egypt and, thus, cannot be reconciled by revisions like those proposed by Heinsohn.&#39; [30]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn order to match the Egyptian tree ring analysis with bristlecone and Irish Oak tree dating analyses, one would expect to find a tree ring chronology for Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean that conforms to those of the other regions. However, trees are and were scarce in countries such as Egypt, so that dendrochronologies of these regions have never been developed. The Eastern Mediterranean tree ring chronology goes back no farther in time than 1073 AD. [31]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eNearly all discussions about dendrochronological studies in catastrophist journals have left out the fact that \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eclimate is only one of several factors affecting tree growth or the production of annual rings.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;GROWTH is the cumulative result of all factors acting on the tree over time.

Stress factors, such as climate, insects and disease, [and] tree competition ... can change dramatically with time and contribute to radical growth fluctuations.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [32]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eInsect infestation and certain diseases are significant factors affecting tree ring development which are not taken into account.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Certain insects cause defoliation, which can greatly inhibit photosynthesis, particularly during periods of insect population surges. During such periodic insect infestations, trees produce less food and deplete the food stored as starch in their roots. When this stored food is deleted, trees produce significantly narrower tree rings. How does one determine the difference between the narrow tree rings of ancient trees which were caused by periodic epidemic defoliation and those caused by climatic conditions? \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ePeriodic plant diseases also result in narrower tree rings\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, particularly those diseases affecting the roots which take in water and minerals for food production. In ancient trees, how does one distinguish between narrow rings caused by periodic root disease and those caused by climate conditions? Even in ideal climates, trees can be affected by insect infestations or by root diseases and nematode attacks. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eTree branch damage during strong, periodic wind storms or heavy snowfalls can also cause problems. After such events, trees must use whatever resources they possess to repair the damage; these resources cannot be utilized for the production of larger tree rings as well.

This can only be done by calibrating the outer rings of living trees against the historical record of temperature variations before using inner rings to find out temperature changes in the more distant past. And among other things, that means throwing out the data from the famous bristlecone pines ... of California where there are no decent records of modern temperatures to establish the calibration.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [33]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn essence, the 7,000-year-old California record paraded before us by Stiebing is based on nothing but assumption. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eNo historical record of temperature variations exists with which to calibrate the outer rings so that one may extrapolate to the inner rings of these trees.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Gribbin tells us that, without this fundamental calibration, the record of the famous bristlecone pines requires that the data collected be thrown out!

These trees are found in mud bogs. One of the methods for correlating tree rings is to find human structures nearby that are known to have been built during or at a certain time. By cross-matching the tree rings of beams in these structures with tree rings from the bogs, it is possible to determine the ages of certain bog trees. However, when one searches the very remote past, one cannot find such well-dated structures; if such are unearthed, their ages cannot be precisely known except by radiocarbon analysis. The problem, in this case, is twofold: First, the manmade structures were found in the earth and the timbers from them that are radiocarbon dated had to have been greatly contaminated by ground water. Second, the bog oaks are lying in earth and water and, thus, any radiocarbon date derived from wood in such an environment must be contaminated by water bearing carbon dioxide. Hence, there is no sure method for precisely corroborating such a very ancient tree ring chronology. Ground water, moving through these bogs, will play havoc with the amount of carbon dioxide that infiltrates the logs. This was found in the organic material from beaches dated by radiocarbon analysis.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe most cogent point that Stiebing makes is that forests of different species of trees, separated from each other by several thousand miles, on different continents, in different climatic environments, will produce tree ring patterns going back several thousand years in which the calibration curves -- which are statistically derived from these separate stands of trees -- will agree with each other.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e He also claims that radiocarbon dating of the wood from these trees supports the view that they have generally similar, statistically derived, calibration curves and that these calibrated curves generally support the conventional chronology for ancient Egypt.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf this is correct, then this method should not only work for the dead trees found in the forests of the American southwest and in Ireland, separated from each other by many miles and cross-matched by the investigators at both locations so that they could build their floating chronologies and derive calibration curves, it should also apply to and produce generally similar results with living bristlecone pine trees separated from each other by only a few hundred miles, forming fixed chronologies. This would be the crucial test of Stiebing&#39;s conclusion. If a few stands of living bristlecone pine tree forests, which are separated by a few hundred miles, are cored, then, based on Stiebing&#39;s statement regarding calibration curves for forests separated by thousands of miles, these living trees should also generate tree ring patterns creating calibration curves that generally match each other. This test is fundamental to the concept proposed.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe point I wish to drive home is that a fixed chronology derived from living trees, as opposed to a floating chronology for dead trees, can never be in doubt because one is not required to assume that cross-matched pieces of dead tree trunks really match one another chronologically. Since mismatches of dead tree trunks rings are possible, one cannot have perfect confidence in this method. On the other hand, with living trees there is always a complete and undisputed set of tree rings going from the present to the past. The dead trees, which require overlapping pieces of cross-matched cores, are only assumed to give an accurate and complete chronology when carefully integrated. Thus, only if the substantiated, living core chronologies show generally similar patterns from their tree rings can the conventional chronology be supported from this evidence. If, however, the substantiated, living core chronologies emphatically disagree with each other, then dendrochronological dating evidence between forests separated by thousands of miles is worthless.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ePaula V. Krebs carried out this experimental work on four stands of living bristlecone pine trees in Colorado. Each of these forests was separated from each other by a few hundred miles.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e The tree ages, from oldest to youngest, spanned 1,568 years, 843 years, 666 years and 457 years. That is, from oldest to youngest, the trees dated from 403 AD, 1138 AD, 1305 AD and 1514 AD.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAccording to Krebs,\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;There are a few similarities in the four chronologies, but the dissimilarities are more striking. For the segment common to all four chronologies, AD 1514 to 1970, there are six common diagnostic points [rings that agree with each other on the calibration curves].\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e These are [for the years] 1645, 1748, 1847, 1851, 1880 and 1902.&#39; [39]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHence, according to Krebs, this extrapolates so that the &#39;1514 to 1970 average [chronologies show] only 1.3 common diagnostic features per century.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [40]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis means that, for each 100 years of the four overlapping bristlecone pine tree chronologies, the average percentage of agreements among the calibration curves was only 1.3%, while 98.7% of the curves were in total disagreement. The chronologies derived from their calibration curves disagreed by almost 99%. According to Krebs, these 98.7% &#39;patterns of the chronologies are very diverse ... Each of these chronologies has a distinct pattern which may be attributed to habitat differences and geographic location. The low level of correspondence prohibits the merging of four separate chronologies into one.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [41]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat should be obvious at this point is that the chronologies of four living stands of bristlecone pine trees completely contradict the notion that Stiebing has put forth -- that forests separated by even a few hundred miles will be integrated to create a single chronology for any group of trees. Therefore, the conjecture that correlated, overlapping, cross-matched, dead tree parts from regions in the American southwest and Ireland have, in fact, generated similar patterns and calibration curves is extraordinarily dubious. If that were the case, the living trees of the same species, inhabiting the same general environment, would exhibit similar patterns.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat Stiebing has assumed is that different climatic zones, on different continents, would affect species of trees in a similar manner. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWe discovered, instead, that, even in the same climatic zone, on the same continent, in fact, in the same general area and with the same general environment, one tree species was influenced in so diverse a manner that no amount of calibration will ever generate similar curves.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Based on this evidence, it is wrong to suggest that any two regions of the Earth, inhabited by trees that are separated by significant distances, will ever allow corroborative comparison.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe fundamental test that validates dendrochronology must prove, conclusively, that there is a basic correlation between tree rings subjected to the same climate conditions while growing in the wild, conditions which produced clearly measurable and similar ring patterns. One would expect that trees growing in the same forest, subject to the same topography, sunlight, rainfall, disease, insect infestation and any other conditions, would all exhibit tree rings correlating strongly with one another. During years of drought, one would expect these tree rings to decrease in size. Warm years, with much rainfall, would create thicker tree rings. If we have a drought for five or six years, followed by a dozen good growth years, we would expect to find that, during this 17-year or 18-year period, small rings would be followed by large rings.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eI am speaking of living trees and not of correlated dead ones. This would be the crucial test for the validity of dendrochronology.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs noted earlier, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment published the results of a study carried out between 1984 and 1990. The study investigated acid rain effects on sugar maple trees, going back to 1900, with three of 11 sites having their earliest growth in 1910, 1920 and 1930. The trees covered a few acres at each site. They had to be on level ground and in full sunlight so as to be subject to exactly the same conditions. Two increment cores were taken, one from the north side of the trees and the other from their south side, mounted on plywood boards and sanded to make the rings stand out more clearly. Phluoroglucinol was used to bring out particularly faint rings. About 10% of the cores had sections so difficult to measure with any degree of confidence that they were not considered. &#39;The cores with the clearest rings were measured first and used as quality control bench marks, against which the less clear tree ring series could be compared.&#39; [42]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe trees were separated into two groups: one was comprised of healthy trees; the other was comprised of sick trees, or trees in decline. Graphs were made of the ring growth of both groups. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSimilarities were noted in the patterns between the two groups, yet great discrepancies were also noted. During some years, while one group of trees had rings that were increasing in size, the other group of trees had rings that were decreasing in size. While the healthy trees producing wide tree rings began to produce narrow ones, the sick trees, originally producing narrow, small rings, began to produce wide, large ones. There was anticorrelation growth between the tree rings of both groups during the same years. Furthermore, anticorrelations were averaged; while some trees in one group produced large tree rings, others in the same group produced much larger ones and while some trees in the other group produced small tree rings, others in the same group produced much smaller ones. This happened often within each of the groups at the 11 sites. The trees were all in the same environment, subjected to the same conditions. Why, then, did anticorrelations occur repeatedly if climate conditions were the same?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Nearly all the conditions were known for this test; therefore, discrepancies can be explained, but not with any degree of certainty or confidence into the remote past.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Ontario researchers make the following admission after analyzing the evidence. They state that &#39;even though the tree rings can be measured with considerable accuracy and the data [can be] de-trended (statistically corrected) to minimize the geometry associated with tree age and stand competition, the effect of climate may be significant and remains largely unquantifiable.&#39; [43] \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis means that the dendrochronologists, with a complete set of tree ring size data from living trees, were unable to determine the climate and its actual influence on the trees. If this is the case for living trees, why does Stiebing expect anyone to accept this methodology for ancient, sparcely scattered wood from dead trees?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Dead trees from the remote past are correlated by the size and patterns of the growth rings. In ancient structures, we rarely ever encounter complete logs; therefore, ancient correlations between tree rings cannot be known as true! That is, apparently, why the Irish Oak chronology has major gaps in it.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhy do living trees show anticorrelations between their tree rings, but we are told that dead trees show correlations? Stiebing has stated that dendrochronology is a reliable dating method. The Canadian dendrochronologists finally did show correlation, but only by choosing comparable ring sizes from each group of trees. This proves nothing! A further point that must also be stressed is that we do not know, nor can it ever be known, whether the dead trees chosen for correlations in the ancient past grew on level ground, in full sunlight. On slopes, such trees would have very different growth patterns; however, if they mimicked the pattern of trees in the same or other localities that were hundreds of years older or younger, they would be included in the group that the tree rings resembled most.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eHow does a dating method with these dendrochronological problems support the conventional chronology?&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[...]\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eREFERENCES:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[29] S.

Good, as a Ph.D. candidate, was sent into South American jungles to evaluate his mentor&#39;s thesis which was in debate. His mentor, Napoleon Chagnon, had claimed that a tribe of people, the Yanamama, were a wild, uncontrolled, fierce, murdering people. Marvin Harris, of Columbia University, had strongly opposed this concept of people being inherently violent, like the ancient hunters.

These fossil remains were buried beneath 33 feet of alluvium which had a sheet of glacial till above it on the surface. The only way to interpret this was to suggest the child died and was either buried slowly or rapidly by alluvium. Then the ice sheet advanced and covered over the area with glacial till. The geologist, A. McS. Stalker, gave the date for the fossil as 30,000 to 40,000 years B.P., or perhaps 20,000 years B.P.

Nevertheless, this prediction was sufficient for an American scientist called Willard Libby to perceive the basis of a dating method.  The theoretical aspects were formulated in the mid 1940s when Libby was Professor of Chemistry at the University of Chicago.  In 1946 he published a paper suggesting that radiocarbon might exist in living matter.  One year later, a single-page paper appeared in the journal Science in which Ernest Anderson and Libby, together with collaborators in Pennsylvania, summarised the first detection of radiocarbon in material of biological origin.  They showed that methane collected from the Baltimore sewage works had measurable radiocarbon activity, whereas methane manufactured from petroleum did not, and the implications of the findings for dating of carbonaceous materials were noted.  These first experiments required enrichment of the radiocarbon in the sample to make it easily detectable.  By 1949, when Libby and Anderson (now joined in Chicago by James Arnold) published results of a world-wide assay of radiocarbon, enrichment was no longer necessary.  \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe assay showed the contemporary level of radiocarbon in wood to be the same globally.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e  The paper also contained the first two results of measurements on archaeological samples.  The end of 1949 saw the publication of radiocarbon results on several samples of known age, and the publication of measurements of unknowns shortly followed.  As Libby himself later recalled, success was by no means a foregone conclusion: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ehe and his colleagues persevered through a &#39;period of two or three years of secret research when we believed that the notion of radiocarbon dating was beyond reasonable credence&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e.

These are designated C12, C13 and C14 in scientific notation, the letter C being the symbol for elemental carbon and the isotopes having atomic weights 12, 13 and 14 respectively.  They do not occur equally: carbon consists of 99% of C12, 1% of C13, but only about one part in a million million of modern carbon is C14.  Unlike C12 and C13, C14 is unstable and therefore radioactive, though only weakly.  Hence the name &#39;radiocarbon&#39; for this isotope which, because of its scientific designation, is also called &#39;carbon fourteen&#39; ...\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe really unusual characteristic of C14 is tht it is continually being formed.  This occurs in the upper atmosphere (strictly the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by the interaction of neutrons produced by cosmic rays with nitrogen atoms.  C14 is therefore one of a small number of &#39;cosmogenic&#39; nucleides.  After formation, the C14 atoms rapidly combine with oxygen to form carbon dioxide which is chemically indistinguishable from carbon dioxide containing either of the other carbon isotopes.  \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis carbon dioxide mixes throughout the atmosphere, dissolves in the oceans and, via the photosynthesis process and the food chain, enters all plant and animal life, known collectively as the biosphere.  Under certain circumstances, in particular if the production rate is constant, there is a dynamic equilibrium between formation and decay, and therefore a constant C14 concentration in the atmosphere.  Thus in principle there is a constant C14 level in all living organisms.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhen a plant or animal dies, it ceases to participate in carbon exchange with the biosphere and no longer takes in C14.  Were C14 stable, its concentration would remain constant after death, but since it is not, the level falls at a rate that is determined by the law of radioactive decay ...&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Necessary Assumptions of the Radiocarbon Dating Technique\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e... The usefulness of any dating technique requires that it be applicable to the materials commonly found on archaeological sites and have a sufficiently low error term to allow temporal differentiation.  \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eEqually fundamental is the need for the method to be globally applicable\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e; it should also be valid at all, or a good range of, periods in the past.  In the case of radiocarbon this in turn requires a global level of C14 in the atmosphere that has not changed with time; in addition, the biosphere should be in equilibrium with the atmosphere.

Whether we liked it or not, we would be compelled to seek a fresh explanation for the origin of living species.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOn this fundamentally important question, the Natural History Museum and all other modern authorities are in complete agreement. The Earth is 4,600 million years old. What is more, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003edifferent periods of the Earth&#39;s history have been characterized by the formation of different kinds of rock containing the fossil remains of distinctive kinds of creature.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e These different periods have also been dated to give what is usually referred to as the Geological Column of the Earth&#39;s history. The column is reproduced on page 69.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eBy referring to the geological column anyone can tell the age of a rock or fossil that he or she finds. For instance, England&#39;s white cliffs consist of chalk dating from the end of the Cretaceous period, which, the column tells us, dates from 65 million years ago.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe dates attached to the geological column have been arrived at and refined over the past century or so. The most recent evaluation, and the one quoted in Natural History Museum publications, is that of Van Eysinga published in 1975. [12] This scheme (which is the source of Figure 1) is closely similar to that used in most museums and universities since the early decades of this century, and is based on the pioneering work of Arthur Holmes in the United Kingdom and Henry Faul in the United States. Some minor disagreements may exist among geologists but a very wide measure of agreement exists over the big issue that the earliest rocks of the column are around 4 billion years old, and over most of the details in Figure 1, for example that the Cretaceous period began around 140 million years ago and ended around 65 million years ago.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhen I began to research this question a little more closely I uncovered a puzzle. Those experts I referred to and the authoritative textbooks I consulted all told me that modern dating has been accomplished by using radioactive methods and hence was an absolute dating method of a far higher order of accuracy than all previous methods -- most of which relied on calculations involving one or more relative factors. These relative dating methods had relied on such factors as the increasing salinity of the oceans, or the Earth&#39;s rate of cooling, and are now considered unreliable. Radioactive dating, though, is used to date the rocks and the fossils they contain directly and hence was welcomed as an absolute method.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe puzzle arises because radioactive dating techniques can be applied only to volcanic rocks that contain some radioactive mineral -- the primary rocks of the Earth&#39;s crust. But the geological column consists of sedimentary rocks -- rocks formed from sediments laid down on the beds of ancient seas and composed of particles of those primary rocks. So, of course, any age determination made using these particles will be the same as that of the primary rocks from which they were derived. In some common sedimentary rocks, such as chalk or limestone, there are not even particles of the primary rocks present and so radioactive dating cannot be used at all.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Happily for English men and women, the white cliffs of Dover are not radioactive.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn The Age of the Earth published by the Institute of Geological Sciences, the position is succinctly explained by John Thackray:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;The only sediments which can be dated directly are those in which a radioactive mineral is formed during diagenesis [laying down] of the sediment\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, such as the rather uncommon illite shales and glauconitic sandstones; other sediments give only the age of the parent rock from which the mineral grains that make them up are derived.&#39; [13]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eHow then did Holmes, Faul, and Van Eysinga arrive at the dates attached to the sediments of the geological column?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;The Institute of Geological Sciences explains:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhere lavas or volcanic ashes are interbedded with a sediment of known stratigraphic age, then a date may be given to that stratigraphic division. Where an igneous rock intrudes one sedimentary unit and is blanketed by another, then the sediments may be dated from the igneous rock by inference. The rarity of such cases, together with analytical error inherent in age determination, mean that isotopic ages are unlikely to rival or replace fossils as the most important means of ... correlation.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt turns out that what has been dated by radioactive decay methods is not the sedimentary rocks or fossils themselves but the isolated intrusion into them of igneous or primary rocks, usually as volcanic material. This has been a rare and purely fortuitous process and one that is unreliable -- so rare and so unreliable that the Institute of Geological Sciences thinks it unlikely to replace or even rival fossils as a method of dating. Nor is this all, for the method depends in turn on a further chain of inference. For \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethe geological column of Van Eysinga is nowhere to be found in nature. It is an imaginary structure that has been synthesized from comparing a stratum of rock in one part of the world with a similar looking stratum in another part of the world\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e ...\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eNaturalists themselves are often confused in their knowledge of this question. Gavin de Beer, for example, director of the British Museum of Natural History from 1950 to 1960, wrote in the introduction to the museum&#39;s guide to evolution, published in 1970,  that the rocks forming the geological column had been dated by radioactive methods:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;Estimates of time based on disintegration of radioactive material enable various levels of evolutionary lineages to be dated and the time measured during which certain changes have occurred, thereby providing quantitative evidence of evolution rates and the duration times of genera and species.&#39; [14]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis claim, which is universally believed and taught in schools and universities throughout the world, is entirely false. And when Darwinists speak of absolute dating of the geological column and the fossils it contains by radioactive methods they are quite mistaken, there is nothing absolute about it. In fact the method ought to be referred to as &#39;comparative dating,&#39; because it dates the sedimentary rocks by inference alone through their relationship to the rare samples of igneous or primary rocks that are being dated.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhen I pursued this question a little further, I found that there is in reality another factor that has been used to arrive at the age of the geological column and the fossils it contains -- conjecture. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis process crept into geological dating at a very early stage when Charles Lyell, the nineteenth century&#39;s most prominent geologist and Darwin&#39;s mentor in geological matters, attempted to date the end of the Cretaceous period by reference to how long he thought it would have taken the shellfish (whose fossils are found in later beds) to have evolved into their modern descendants.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Lyell estimated that the Cretaceous ended 80 million years ago -- not too far from today&#39;s accepted figure of 65 million, plus or minus 3 million.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAccording to Harold Levin of Washington University, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;By comparing the amount of evolution exhibited by the marine molluscs in the various series of the Tertiary System with the amount that had occurred since the beginning of the Pleistocene Ice Age, Lyell estimated that 80 million years had elapsed since the beginning of the Cenozoic.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [15]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eLevin adds that, &#39;He came astonishingly close to the mark.&#39; \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn fact, it is not at all astonishing when you know that today&#39;s accepted date has been derived not from an absolute, independent source but from conjectures including Lyell&#39;s.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe kind of surmise used to supplement the relative dates yielded by radioactive dating includes assumptions about the rates at which sediments are laid down on the bottoms of lakes, seashores, and ocean floors; estimates of the rates at which forests are turned into coal deposits; and estimates of the rates at which certain very long-lived families of creatures might have evolved. But although these conjectures are embodied in the modern view of the age of geological deposits, they are rarely if ever disclosed in geological or biological textbooks, and they are rarely exposed to debate.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eCuriously, too, no geologist seems to have checked out the geological column dates with an electronic calculator on a commonsense basis. Let us go back to the illustration of the column in Figure 1 and look again at the thickness of the rocks in each period compared with the length of time assigned to those periods. Note \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethat there is a remarkable consistency between assigned age and thickness of deposit.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e For instance the Cretaceous period is said to have lasted 65 million years and is 15,000 meters thick -- an average annual rate of deposition of 0.2 millimeters. Now look at the Silurian period: this, too, yields an average rate of deposition of about 0.2 millimeters per year -- as does the Ordovician, the Devonian, the Carboniferous, and the rest. It is only when we come to relatively modern times in the Cenozoic era that rates of deposition vary much, and here they appear to speed up slightly.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis is a very remarkable finding. One naturally expects Uniformitarian geology to favor uniformity, but this is too much of a good thing. Throughout widely changing climatic conditions, advancing and retreating oceans, droughts, and Ice Ages, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethe rate of sedimentation appears to remain amazingly constant regardless throughout the thousands of millions of years that are said to have elapsed\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e. The presumed rate of deposition itself -- about the thickness of a human hair in a year -- is a matter looked at in more detail later. But it is worth pausing in passing to note that such a slow rate would be quite incapable of burying and fossilizing entire forests, dinosaurs, or even a medium-sized tadpole.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOf course, all these sediments, with their time capsule contents of fossilized creatures from the past, were laid down long after the Earth was formed and long after the decisive event took place in the chain of evolution -- the origin of life itself in ancient seas. It is the rock from which those later sediments were derived -- the primary bedrock of the Earth&#39;s crust -- in which we are chiefly interested if we wish to date the Earth.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe key question remains: How old is the Earth? And to examine the answer that has come to be accepted on this score, we must look more closely at radioactive methods of dating.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eCHAPTER 4\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Key to the Past?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE SECOND WORLD WAR, American chemist Willard Libby made a discovery that won him the Nobel prize for chemistry, which revolutionized the study of the Earth&#39;s prehistory, but which ultimately was to provide unexpectedly disconcerting evidence on the age of the Earth itself.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eLibby&#39;s discovery was the now-famous radiocarbon method of determining the age of organic remains, which gave archeologists their first practical tool for routinely dating the past. At the time of its discovery and its first application to archeological sites around the world in 1949, the radiocarbon method appeared to confirm that humankind&#39;s past was indeed of great antiquity and that geologists and evolutionists had been perfectly justified in continually pushing further back in time the dawn of humanity.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eField archeologists in the 1950s, applying the new power given them by chemistry, confidently assigned absolute dates to early human prehistoric settlements with a precision that must have astounded their teachers of a generation before. The city of Jericho was said to have been a thriving human settlement 11,000 years ago, while Neolithic sites in Russia and Africa were dated as being well over 50,000 years old. The author of Encyclopaedia Britannica&#39;s article on prehistoric Mrica, for instance, says &#39;Radiocarbon dating suggests that the Earlier Stone Age may have lingered on until about 55,000 B.c.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe readiness of science today to accept a great antiquity for the Earth and humankind contrasts sharply with the attitude of scientists little more than a century ago. This radical change in outlook involved the overthrow of the old geological belief in a catastrophic origin for the rocks of the Earth&#39;s crust and its replacement by the modern uniformitarian theory -- the idea that the rocks have formed slowly over millions or billions of years.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAt the time that Darwin set sail for South America in the Beagle in 1831, the Earth&#39;s age was reckoned merely in thousands of years, and not many thousands at that. One well-known early attempt to date the Earth is that of Archbishop James Ussher of Armagh, a noted Bible scholar who deduced through careful analysis of biblical texts that the Earth was created in 4004 B.C.. The Archbishop&#39;s finding was published in 1650 and soon after was added as a marginal notation to the Book of Genesis in the Authorized Version of the Bible where it remained until Victorian times, and can still be found occasionally today.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eA contemporary of the Archbishop, Dr. John Lightfoot, Master of St Catherine&#39;s College and Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University, was able to endorse this date and indeed refine it with astounding precision. &#39;Man was created by the Trinity,&#39; wrote Dr. Lightfoot, &#39;on October 23rd 4004 B.C. at nine o&#39;clock in the morning.&#39; \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs Ronald Millar has pointed out, only a Cambridge Vice Chancellor would have the audacity to assign the date and time of the creation to the beginning of the academic year.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [1]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eA number of the influential geologists in Darwin&#39;s day were also clergymen whose religious views strongly influenced their scientific beliefs. This religious complexion to geology in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries -- an otherwise flourishing era for rationalist thinking in science -- influenced theories of rock formation and the age of the Earth in two important ways.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst, widespread acceptance of the biblical creation story contained in Genesis meant that the cleric-geologists neglected to question how the Earth began or how life originated because they believed they already had the answers to these questions. And second, the creation story constituted a ready-made theory to accommodate all their scientific observations (often meticulously detailed) thereby stifling the formation of any new theory when they discovered new evidence in the field.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhen these researchers found thousands of feet of compacted mudlike sediments containing the bones of dead animals, the discovery was taken as clear evidence of Noah&#39;s flood described in the Bible. Hence the prevailing geological theory of the pre-Darwinian era was that of catastrophism -- the doctrine that the rocks of the Earth&#39;s crust were formed more or less simultaneously as a result of a divinely ordained Great Flood.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSome of the attempts by pre-nineteenth century geologists to fit their observations to biblical teaching appear obviously contrived and rather absurd from our perspective today. Swiss naturalist Johann Scheuchzer, who discovered some early vertebrate remains of a salamander around 1720, exhibited them widely as the remains of the imaginatively named Homo diluvii testis -- Man, a witness to the flood.

They rejected catastrophism and instead found the mechanism they sought in an idea taking shape among the new generation of secular geologists who asserted that sedimentary rocks (that is, fossilbearing rocks) were formed slowly by the same processes that can be seen on the ocean bottom today: the deposition of silt and sand that becomes cemented and compacted over millions of years to form successive strata of rock.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eUnder the reassuring-sounding label of uniformitarianism these ideas were actively promoted by secular geologists like James Hutton and later Charles Lyell, who was Darwin&#39;s coach on geological issues. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe uniformitarian doctrine is summed up in the famous phrase &#39;the present is the key to the past&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e -- a concept eagerly accepted by Darwinists as ready-made for their theory and one expounded on at length in Lyell&#39;s Principles of Geology, the primary geological work of the century, published between 1824 and 1833.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe important point to note here is that it was the imperative need for great antiquity that deposed catastrophism, rather than any new scientific discoveries or observations; it was a new way of looking at things, not a new piece of knowledge. But, superficially, the change in view seemed to be a shift away from naive belief in biblical tales of creation and flood, and toward a newly established scientific viewpoint.

Thus an unusual academic interdependence sprang up between the two sciences that continues to this day. A geologist wishing to date a rock stratum would ask an evolutionist&#39;s opinion on the fossils it contained. An evolutionist having difficulty dating a fossil species would turn to the geologist for help.

It was at Como Bluffs in the 1870s and 1880s that paleontologists such as Edward Cope and O. C. Marsh discovered more than 120 new species of dinosaur, including diplodocus and stegasaurus.

To appreciate exactly why the radiocarbon technique has had such unexpected consequences, it is necessary first to look at just how the technique was supposed to work.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eRadiocarbon -- radioactive carbon 14 -- is a form of carbon created in the upper atmosphere by the bombardment of cosmic particles from space. As radioactive carbon dioxide it permeates the atmosphere and passes into the bodies of plants and animals through the food chain. To any plant or animal, carbon 14 is indistinguishable from the common carbon (carbon 12) which occurs naturally on Earth. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eRadiocarbon is relatively rare, so of the total amount of carbon in the body of a plant or animal only a minute fraction is radiocarbon. What makes this tiny fraction useful for dating, argued Libby, is that the proportion of radiocarbon is the same for all living animals and plants the world over, and something that can readily be measured.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eRadiocarbon begins to decay as soon as it is formed. When a quantity of radiocarbon is produced in the atmosphere, half of that amount will have decayed away (becoming nitrogen gas) in some 5,700 years. Half the remainder will decay in a further 5,700 years, and so on, until an immeasurably small residue remains. Once a plant or animal dies, it ceases to take in radiocarbon from the &#39;terrestrial reservoir&#39; or outside world, so the amount of radiocarbon in its body begins to dwindle through decay while the ordinary carbon remains unchanged. So, 5,700 years after a tree dies, it contains only half the proportion of radiocarbon to common carbon that exists in a living tree, and in the living world in general. After a total of 11,400 years, or two half-lives, it will  contain only one quarter the proportion in the outside world, and so on. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAfter about five half-lives, or roughly 30,000 years, only an immeasurably small residue remains and so the radiocarbon test is only good for dating remains younger than this natural &#39;ceiling.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTo date an organic find (the test only works, of course, on the remains of once-living things, such as bones in a Neolithic burial, or Roman fence posts) it is only necessary to measure the amount of remnant radioactive carbon with a suitable counter and hence deduce when the specimen ceased to take in radiocarbon -- when it died.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe great value of the test is that only a tiny fragment of an irreplaceable papyrus or rare skull is needed because it is the proportion of radiocarbon to ordinary carbon that is measured and compared with the proportions that exist in the terrestrial reservoir or living world today. In the end the whole technique rests, therefore, on knowing with some precision the ratio of radiocarbon to common carbon in the terrestrial reservoir today, and it was for making these measurements as well as developing the dating technique that Libby was awarded the Nobel prize.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThere is just one further factor of some importance for the test to work properly: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethe standard mix of radiocarbon to ordinary carbon in the terrestrial reservoir must always have been the same throughout the lifetime of the test subject and in the years since its death.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Take the case of archeologists setting out to determine the age of a Neolithic woman whose burial chamber they discover.

Had there been a lot less radiocarbon around during her life, then the reading will appear falsely diminished and she will appear much older.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAt the time that Libby and his co-workers were developing the new technique, in the 1940s, they had every reason to believe that the amount of carbon 14 in the world could not possibly have varied during the time that humankind had been on Earth simply because the Earth is of immense age, some 4,600 million years old. This great age stamps the radiocarbon technique with the seal of  respectability because of what Libby called the &#39;equilibrium value&#39; for the radiocarbon reservoir.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAfter the Earth was formed and acquired an atmosphere, there would be a 30,000 year transition period during which carbon 14 would be building up. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAt the end of that period, the amount of carbon 14 created by cosmic radiation will be balanced by the amount of carbon 14 decaying away to almost zero. To use Libby&#39;s terminology, at the end of 30,000 years, the terrestrial radiocarbon reservoir will have reached a steady state.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSince the Earth, according to uniformitarian geology, is many, many times older than the 30,000 years needed to fill up the reservoir, then radiocarbon must unquestionably have attained equilibrium billions of years ago, and must have been constantly so throughout the few million years allotted to human history. To test this essential part of the theory, Libby made measurements of both the rate of formation and the rate of decay of radiocarbon. He found a considerable discrepancy in his measurements indicating that, apparently, radiocarbon was being created in the atmosphere somewhere around 25 percent faster than it was becoming extinct. Since this result was inexplicable by any conventional scientific means, Libby put the discrepancy down to experimental error.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [3]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDuring the 1960s, Libby&#39;s experiments were repeated by chemists who had been able to refine their techniques after a decade or so of experience.

The book was called Prehistory and Earth Models and was by the professor of metallurgy at Utah University, Dr. Melvin Cook. [1] Cook, a physical chemist now in his eighties, is a world expert on high explosives and his textbook on explosives for mining is still a classic work of reference. Professors of metallurgy do not usually stir up trouble in the academic world, but what I had read in his geology book was more explosive than any text on TNT.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn his preface Cook wrote: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;An attempt to publish a manuscript giving direct evidence for the short-time chronometry of the atmosphere and oceans entitled &#39;Anomalous Chronometry in the Atmosphere and Hydrosphere,&#39; not unexpectedly nor without some cause, met with considerable opposition and was not published.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWho on earth had prevented Dr. Cook from publishing his paper? I wondered. And what could a metallurgy professor have to say that was so heretical that someone wanted to prevent its publication? I found that his book contained scientific evidence and reasoned argument which showed that something was terribly wrong with the orthodox scientific view of methods of dating. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe most widely used methods, such as uranium-lead and potassium-argon, had been found to be seriously flawed, not merely in practice but in principle. In addition, the methods yielded dates so discordant as to make them unreliable.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eCook showed for example that if you used the uranium-decay method on the rocks of the crust you got the conventionally accepted age of over four thousand million years. But if you used the selfsame method on the atmosphere, you got an age of only a few hundred thousand years. He also showed that the entire amount of &#39;radiogenic&#39; lead in the world&#39;s two largest uranium deposits could be entirely modern. Clearly something was wrong.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhen I dug deeper, I found that Cook was not a lone voice. Other papers by scientists in reputable scientific journals expressed similar doubts and findings. Funkhouser and Naughton at the Hawaiian Institute of Geophysics used the potassium-argon method to date volcanic rocks from Mount Kilauea and got ages of up to 3 thousand million years -- when the rocks are known to have been formed in a modern eruption in 1801. McDougall at the Australian National University found ages of up to 465,000 years for lava in New Zealand that is independently known to be less than 1,000 years old.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eI eventually came to the alarming realization that although radioactive decay is the most stable source of chronometry we have today, it is badly compromised as a historical timekeeper, because it is not the rate of decay that is being measured but the amount of decay products left. For this reason, all radioactive methods of geochronometry are deeply flawed and cannot be relied on with any real confidence in this application.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAt the end of the last chapter, I asked, How could science have gone so far wrong? The answer turns out to be that it is not science which has gone wrong, merely those scientists seeking to defend a single idea -- Darwinian evolution. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eScience has proposed many methods of geochronometry -- measuring the Earth&#39;s age -- all of which are subject to some uncertainties, for reasons I shall describe in a moment. But of these many methods, only one technique -- that of the radioactive decay of uranium and similar elements -- yields an age for the Earth of billions of years. And it is this one method that has been enthusiastically promoted by Darwinists and uniformitarian geologists, while all other methods have been neglected.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSo successful has this promotional campaign been that today almost everyone, including scientists working in other fields, has been led to believe that radioactive dating is the only method of geochronometry worth considering, and that it is well-nigh unassailable because of the universal constancy of radioactive decay. In fact, none of these widely held beliefs is supported by the evidence.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTo appreciate how and why radiometric methods are flawed, first look a little more closely at the problems which confront the geologist attempting to measure the Earth&#39;s age.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAll methods of measuring time, whether for domestic or scientific purposes, rely on the same basic principle: monitoring the rate of some constant natural process. Today our most sophisticated chronometric methods involve the rate at which a quartz crystal vibrates when an electric potential is applied to it, and the rate at which radioactive elements decay -- said to be the most constant source of all.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut having some readily available process to measure is not enough by itself. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eTo measure elapsed time accurately we must be sure that the process does in fact remain constant, even when we are not watching. You must know the starting value of the clock -- how much water was in your water clock to begin with or how tall your candle was before it was lit. And you must be sure that some external factor cannot interfere with the process while it is in operation, for instance, that a temporary power cut does not stop your electric clock while you are out walking your dog.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAll these conditions apply to measuring time today. When it comes to the science of geochronometry, the process we choose will have started in prehistoric times, which we have no method of directly observing and verifying. This means we must make sure as far as possible that our three conditions were met in the past as well as in the present -- and it is here that our problems begin.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSuppose, for instance, we were to take the increasing salinity of the oceans as a means of finding out how old the Earth is (a method actually proposed in 1898 by Irish geologist John Joly). On the face of it this is a promising method, since it can be assumed that initially the oceans consisted of fresh water, and the present-day accumulation of salt is due to erosion of land masses by rainfall and the subsequent transport of dissolved salt into the seas by way of the world&#39;s rivers. Even more encouraging is the fact that the rate of erosion of the land by rainfall is surprisingly constant each year -- about 540 million tons of salt a year. All that would be necessary is to measure the present-day concentration of salt in the sea (32 grams per litre); calculate from this the total amount in all the oceans (about 5 x 1016 tons); and divide this total by the annual amount of salt deposited to get the age of the Earth in years. [2]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eUsing this method, Joly came up with an age of 100 million years. Unfortunately, when we apply the three conditions mentioned earlier to this method its shortcomings quickly become obvious. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eFirst, we cannot be sure that the annual runoff of dissolved salt has always been constant.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Indeed there is good reason to suppose that climatic conditions have been very different in the past -- with ice ages and major droughts for instance -- and these conditions might have had an effect that is incalculable.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSecond, we cannot be quite sure that there was zero salt in the sea to begin with.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Initially, some salt might have been present, though no one can say how much, if any. (Recent research in the Atlantic suggests that salts may have been extruded into ocean basins from the molten magma beneath the crust.) \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnd third, it turns out that an apparently constant process is interfered with by external factors.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Large amounts of salt are recirculated into the atmosphere, and recent evidence suggests that the salt in the sea might actually be in a steady state -- as fast as salt is deposited in the sea, it is picked up in the air and redeposited on land again. A large quantity of salt is evaporated by biological processes and still more is incorporated into bottom sediments through chemical processes, spoiling our &#39;clock.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAll methods of measuring the age of the Earth are subject, to some extent, to the same defects -- quite simply, no one was there at the time to check up on our three criteria.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e The technique used by uniformitarian geologists to arrive at the tremendous age of 4,600 million years for the Earth is usually referred to simply as the &#39;uranium&#39; or &#39;uranium-lead&#39; method. Sometimes it is popularly referred to merely as radioactive or radiometric dating. The technique in question covers a family of methods involving the radioactive decay of a number of different metallic elements with very long half-lives (they stay radioactive for very long periods). These elements include uranium and its sister element thorium, which both decay into helium and lead; rubidium, which decays into strontium; and potassium, which decays into argon and calcium.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe basic principle is this: over very long periods of time uranium spontaneously decays into lead and helium gas. The rate of decay is remarkably constant. The atoms of the uranium are unstable and periodically throw out an alpha particle, which is the nucleus of an atom of helium. It is impossible to tell in advance when any particular atom will break apart in this way since the process occurs at random. But in any substantial mass of the mineral there will be many billions of atoms, and with very large numbers of events the &#39;law of large numbers&#39; operates to produce a statistically predictable result.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe important part of the theory is that the kind of lead into which uranium eventually decays is chemically distinctive from common lead already present in the rocks, and is referred to as radiogenic lead, a daughter product of the decay process. Common lead is an isotope called lead 204, while the decay product of uranium 238 is lead 206. In order to date a rock deposit a sample is taken and the amount of radioactive uranium, together with the amount of radiogenic lead it contains, is accurately assayed in the laboratory. Since the rate of decay is known from modern measurements, it is possible to calculate directly how long the uranium has been decaying -- how old the deposit is -- by how much radiogenic lead it has turned into.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe half-life of uranium 238 (one of the principal isotopes used) has been calculated to be 4,500 million years. To take a simplistic example, if the assay showed that a deposit was composed of half uranium 238 and half its daughter product lead 206, then one would draw the conclusion that the deposit was 4,500 million years old. (This, incidentally, is the average figure that is found for the Earth&#39;s crust although the figure is arrived at by extrapolation rather than direct measurement.)\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOn the face of it, uranium decay seems an ideal method of geochronometry, and above scientific suspicion. But, as in the case of radiocarbon dating, research in recent decades has begun to cast serious doubts on its reliability.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe first criterion for any method of geochronometry is that we must know the starting value of the process we are measuring; we must have a point of departure, or reference point, from which to make our calculations. On the face of it, uranium decay fulfills this requirement since the type of lead which results is said to be uniquely formed as a by-product of this process. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf radiogenic lead -- lead 206 and lead 207 from uranium, and lead 208 from thorium -- really is uniquely formed as the end product of disintegration, then it is perfectly reasonable to suppose, as adherents of radioactive dating do, that there was zero radiogenic lead in the rocks of the Earth&#39;s crust when they first formed, and so we have a reliable starting point for our calculations.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e The same argument can be used to make us reasonably certain that no radiogenic lead could have intruded into the rocks by some other means, thus distorting the effects of the decay process.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut things are by no means as simple as they seem when investigated a little more closely. Cook has suggested there is another, and quite separate, mechanism by which common lead can be transmuted into a form which, on assay, will be indistinguishable from &#39;radiogenic&#39; lead. This transmutation can occur through the capture of free neutrons -- atomic particles with enough energy to transmute common lead into so-called radiogenic lead. Where, though, could such a source of free neutrons be found? The answer is in a radioactive ore deposit such as uranium, where they occur through spontaneous fission!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn other words, the very process being measured can be moonlighting at another job. As well as spontaneously decaying into radiogenic lead, it is also making available a supply of particles which are simultaneously converting common lead into another isotope which, on being assayed, will be indistinguishable from a radiogenic product of alpha decay. Significantly, this is a mechanism that would tip our measurements in favor of an &#39;old&#39; Earth. Too much &#39;radiogenic&#39; lead would lead us to imagine that the process has been going on for much longer than it actually has.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the neutron capture process, the isotopic values of lead would be systematically changed: lead 206 would be converted into lead 207, and lead 207 into lead 208. Interestingly, lead 208 usually constitutes more than half the lead present in any given deposit. This is normally interpreted as meaning that thorium, the parent element of lead 208, was very common in the deposit in question, although it could also be interpreted as indicating that free neutron capture is a far more important process in lead isotope formation than radioactive decay.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn Prehistory and Earth Models, Cook examined the lead content of two of the world&#39;s largest uranium ore deposits -- in Zaire and Canada. He found that they contained practically no Thorium 232. However they do contain significant amounts of lead 208. This could have been derived only from lead 207 by neutron capture, says Cook, while all the so-called radiogenic lead can be accounted for on the same basis and the mineral deposits could be essentially of modern origin.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [3]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBecause Cook is a creationist as well as a scientist and because creationists have used Cook&#39;s findings as ammunition for their cause, strenuous attempts have been made by some scientists, such as G. Brent Dalrymple, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, to discredit him and his research. [4] So far, however, neither Dalrymple nor any other dating advocate has offered a satisfactory explanation for the finding that there is practically no thorium 232 in the world&#39;s two largest uranium deposits, but that there are significant quantities of lead 208.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eDalrymple and others have asserted that the level of free neutrons available is too low to be capable of causing any significant change in the ratio of lead isotopes in deposits such as these. But if that assertion is correct then it becomes impossible to account on any rational basis for the quantities of lead 208 in Zaire and Canada.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSo uranium decay fails the most important criterion for a reliable method of geochronometry. But it also fails a second criterion -- that we must be reasonably sure no outside agency can interfere with the smooth running of our chosen process. Uranium does not naturally occur in metallic form but as uranium oxide. This material is highly soluble in water and is known to be moved away from its original deposit in large quantities by ground waters. The type of effect this has on dating is unpredictable since some parts of a mineral deposit can be unnaturally enriched while others are unnaturally depleted.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThere is one further discovery relating to uranium dating that is of considerable relevance to attempts to measure the age of the Earth. As mentioned earlier, the final disintegration products of the decay process are two, not only lead but also helium gas. Like the lead which results from the decay process, the helium is also a radiogenic daughter product with an atomic weight of 4. In fact almost the entire amount of helium in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is believed to be radiogenic helium, formed during the decay process throughout most of the Earth&#39;s history.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eNow, if the uranium-lead dating technique were reliable, then the amount of this radiogenic helium in the atmosphere would yield a date for the Earth&#39;s age consonant with that yielded by measuring the amount of radiogenic lead in the crust. In fact, the dates are so different as to be irreconcilable.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf the Earth were 4,600 million years old, then there would be roughly 10,000 billion tons of radiogenic helium 4 in the atmosphere. Actually, there are only around 3.5 billion tons presentseveral thousand times less than there should be (0.035 percent to be precise).\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWriting in Nature on the &#39;mystery&#39; of the Earth&#39;s missing radiogenic helium, Melvin Cook says,\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;At the estimated 2 x 10^20 gm uranium and 5 x 10^20 gm thorium in the lithosphere, helium should be generated radiogenically at a rate of about 3 x 10^9 gm/yr. Moreover the (secondary) cosmic-ray source of helium has been estimated to be of comparable magnitude. Apparently nearly all the helium from sedimentary rocks and, according to Keevil and Hurley, about 0.8 of the radiogenic helium from igneous rocks, has been released into the atmosphere during geological times (currently taken to be about 5 x 10^9 yr). Hence more than 10^20 gm of helium should have passed into the atmosphere since the &#39;beginning.&#39; Because the atmosphere contains only 3.5 x 10^15 gm helium 4, the common assumption is therefore that about 10^20 gm of helium 4 must also have passed out through the exosphere, and that the present rate of loss through the atmosphere balances the rate of exudation from the lithosphere. &#39;[5]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eCook says that uniformitarian geologists have attempted to explain this discrepancy by assuming that the other 99.96 percent has escaped from the Earth&#39;s gravitational field into space -- but this process has not been observed.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eG.

Moreover, as argon is an inert gas that will not react with any other element, its atoms will always be trapped in the crystal structures of minerals whether it is radiogenic in origin or not. Cook has calculated that even if the Earth were five billion years old, no more than 1 percent of the argon 40 currently present on Earth could be a radiogenic daughter product and it is thus highly probable that some of the argon 40 in all potassium minerals has been derived directly rather than as a result of decay.

However, this technique is again complicated by the fact that strontium 87 also occurs both as a daughter product of radioactive decay and as a commonly occurring element in its own right. Typically, rocks contain ten times more common strontium 87 than radiogenic strontium 87. Rubidium-strontium is also suspect because it is subject to exactly the same neutron capture process as uranium-lead.

Where this occurs, a &#39;harmonization&#39; of discordant dates is carried out -- in other words, the figures are adjusted until they seem right. The chief tool employed to harmonize discordant dates is the simple device of labeling unexpected ages as anomalous and, in the future, discarding those rock samples that will lead to the &#39;anomalous&#39; dates. This practice is the explanation of why many dating results seem to support each other -- because all samples that give ages other than expected values are rejected as being &#39;unsuitable&#39; for dating.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf radioactive dating is seriously flawed as claimed here, why is it so enthusiastically embraced by dating scientists and so readily accepted by their academic colleagues?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOn the face of it, radioactive dating is the most accurate source of chronometry available. Indeed, our most trustworthy timepieces are atomic clocks: clocks regulated by precisely the same processes used in dating techniques.

The accuracy of such techniques is not only critically dependent on the constancy of the rate of decay, but it is even more critically dependent on the accurate assay of the residue of the decay process -- how much argon 40 is left or how much strontium 87 is left -- and how that residue is distinguished from the nonradiogenic argon 40, or strontium 87, that occurs naturally in the same rocks.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis issue has nothing to do with how constant radioactive decay processes may be: it is purely a human problem in measurement.

When errors in radiometric dates are pointed out by critics, advocates of the method usually dismiss such criticism on the grounds that errors are very rare in comparison with the thousands of dates that are not found to be incorrect. This is a misleading argument because the overwhelming majority of dates could never be challenged or found to be flawed since there is no genuinely independent evidence that can contradict those dates. The reason why known anomalies are very rare is simply because independent evidence is very rare.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat is alarming is that in the very few cases of truly independent evidence we have -- such as Mrs. Ahrens&#39;s rock paintings, and the volcanic lavas in Hawaii and New Zealand -- the measured dates are spectacularly wrong. The response of radioactive dating advocates is to reject the few cases of independent verification as aberrations, and to prefer instead their theory purely because of its internal consistency, principally that it fits with a belief in an old Earth. In doing so, they are rejecting the only real independent check available.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSecond, there is the phenomenon of &#39;ballpark&#39; thinking. This is exemplified by the error that was made in the curvature of the mirror for the Hubble space telescope. The error was not discovered by normal inspection processes, even in one of the world&#39;s best-equipped laboratories, because it was so big -- more than a centimeter out -- that it was outside the range that anyone was mentally prepared to check on.

More significantly, perhaps, he would not be able to get any funding for his research.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eA third potential source of error is the phenomenon of&#39;intellectual phase-locking.&#39; It is not widely realized that the published value of physical constants often varies. Before it was settled internationally by definition, the measured value for the velocity of light varied considerably, as did the gravitational constant and Planck&#39;s constant. One reason for such variation is that all scientists make experimental errors that they have to correct. They naturally prefer to correct them in the direction of the currently accepted value thus giving an unconscious trend to measured values. This group thinking has even been given a name: &#39;intellectual phase-locking.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eFourth, there are powerful professional pressures on scientists to conform to a consensus. Dating geologists are offended by the suggestion that their beliefs can or would influence the dates obtained.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Yet nothing could be easier or more natural. Take for example a rock sample from the late Cretaceous, a period which is universally believed to date from some 65 million years ago. Any dating scientist who obtained a date from the sample of, say, 10 million years or 150 million years, would not publish such a result because he or she will, quite sincerely, assume it was in error. On the other hand, any dating scientist who did obtain a date of 65 million years would hasten to publish it as widely as possible. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThus the published dating figures always conform to preconceived dates and never contradict those dates. If all the rejected dates were retrieved from the waste basket and added to the published dates, the combined results would show that the dates produced are the scatter that one would expect by chance alone.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDating scientists have looked for a technique that would enable them to eliminate the problems of the simple accumulation clock method caused by inclusion or depletion of daughter isotopes.

The main reason for believing this is that both of the two disturbing phenomena -- inclusion or depletion of daughter isotope -- will affect the different isotopes in a rock sample differentially, so they can no longer be made to lie on the same straight line when their ages are plotted on an Isochron graph.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOn the face of it, the Isochron technique solves the basic problem of the simple accumulation clock method. In reality, it solves it only in a single limiting case -- the case where all daughter isotopes are measured with perfect accuracy. If there is any systematic reason why the assay of the daughter isotopes is flawed, then the Isochron method is worse than useless -- it is actively misleading, because it will cause geologists to place a high level of confidence in results that are actually false.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut, of course, the whole problem with radiometric methods is the difficulty of making accurate assays of the daughter isotopes coupled with the fact that there are a number of pressures compelling geologists to arrive at certain acceptable target dates and reject unacceptable dates in their published results.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn reality the apparent concordance of some of the dates derived by Isochron radiometric techniques is an artifact of two influences: the selection of &#39;suitable&#39; rock samples for assay and the rejection of &#39;unsuitable&#39; samples; and the selection of only some dates for publication and the nonpublication of others as being erroneous.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThat the Isochron technique does not, in practice, provide the high level of confidence that some geologists attribute to it can be seen in the case history examined later in this chapter.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn evaluating the strength of the evidence and arguments against radiometric dating, the sticking point for many reasonable people is that a great age for the Earth -- in the region of 4,500 million years -- seems securely arrived at, whatever lesser problems may remain to be ironed out in radiometric dating techniques. Yet, as Melvin Cook has pointed out, the Earth may be made of materials that are 4,500 million years old and yet still have been formed relatively recently.

[15]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eCommenting on the discordant dating, Fitch said, &#39;Potassiumargon apparent ages in the range 1.6 - 1.8 million years obtained from the KBS Tuff by other workers are regarded as discrepant, and may have been obtained from samples affected by argon loss.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat is especially interesting about these results is that both teams used Isochron methods -- the methods that are claimed to ensure mistakes cannot be made simply because of anomalous loss or gain of argon, as in the Hawaiian lavas. Thus Fitch was alleging that the Berkeley team had got their sums wrong precisely because they failed to allow for argon loss -- the very fault that my critic assured me was &#39;the sort of thing that is allowed for in radiometric dating.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePerhaps because the issue of discordance had become public, Fitch went even further in his Nature paper and disclosed that the Berkeley group reported &#39;scatter&#39; in their dates ranging from 1.5 to 6.9 million years, a range large enough to cast some doubts on the accuracy of their work. By comparison, in their own experiments, Fitch and his colleagues claimed much lower &#39;scatter&#39; in apparent ages ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 million years implying that their measurements were more accurate. [16]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe controversy was brought to a close in 1981 by an argon-40-to-argon-39 study by Ian McDougall of the Australian National University, giving a date of 1.88 million years. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs this was halfway between the two previous discordant studies, the combatants decided to call it a day -- even though it meant they were both wrong by a large margin.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [17]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn his paper McDougall frankly confessed that &#39;conventional potassium-argon, argon-argon and fission track dating of pumice clasts within this tuff have yielded a distressingly large range of ages.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [18]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIndeed, McDougall went even further than this rare emotive statement, because he revealed that the &#39;scatter&#39; referred to by Fitch was in reality even greater than that of Curtis. Fitch and Miller actually reported results of ages ranging from 0.52 to 2.64 million years for one set of samples and ages from 8.43 to 17.5 million years on another sample before eventually settling on their 2.6-million-year date.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eMcDougall concluded, &#39;On the basis of the large scatter in the ages and the small proportion of argon-40 in the gas extracted from the anorthoclase concentrates, I suggest that the results are analytically less precise than given by these authors.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the restrained diplomatic language of science, this is the equivalent of one scientist whacking another over the head with the sort of club that Lake Turkana Man was probably using on his enemies anywhere between 0.5 and 17.5 million years ago.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOne aspect of this affair that deserves special attention is that all the scientists dating the formation started by selecting rocks they thought were the right age and discarding samples which seemed wrong. No one doubts that this is done honestly and intelligently. But the question must be asked: How do dating scientists know in advance which are the right rocks and which the wrong rocks? What scientifically led them to reject dates of 0.5 million years or 17.5 million years in favor of 2.6 million?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe answer that dating adherents give is that any scientist would exclude the few extreme measurements and settle for the majority of figures that are clustered together in a straight line or &#39;plateau&#39; when the results are plotted graphically. But, of course, had they measured the salinity of the oceans as a means of geochronometry (a method which as we saw earlier is known to be flawed) they would have found the same kind of &#39;plateau&#39; grouping for most results, regardless of where they took their seawater samples, because the method itself is systematically flawed. The majority of their dates would have been in the range of 100 million years because that is what the current salt content and annual erosion figures indicate. Constancy of results is not an indicator of correctness when the method itself is defective.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe truth is that, to those who dated the KBS Tuff, the chosen date of 2.6 million years seemed to be more &#39;reasonable&#39; than 0.5 million or 17.5 million. And the word reasonable in this context can be interpreted only as meaning consistent with uniformitarian and Darwinist beliefs on dating.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e The objection to this viewpoint is that &#39;being reasonable&#39; is not an acceptable substitute for scientific measurement and proof.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe fact is that presently it is impossible to say with any confidence how old the Earth is, beyond the obvious fact that it predates the calendar of human history.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23absolutedating\"\u003e#absolutedating\u003c/a\u003e     \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23geochronometry\"\u003e#geochronometry\u003c/a\u003e   \ufeff",

It&#39;s amazing that so much can be said about these games without people losing interest.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt&#39;s a tremendous amount of activity that happens across the world.  To be sure, friendships have been lost over sports disagreements.  Marriages have surely collapsed.  And many students have become convinced that they can succeed in life without actually studying or even paying heed to the universe which science is slowly unraveling around them.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eOur cultural infatuation with sports today is maybe testament to our short attention spans in that we can be entertained by sports without knowing too much detail about the teams, players or even -- to some extent -- the rules.  We can experience an immediate reaction to the action on the field; there&#39;s very little actual effort or barrier to immediate enjoyment of these games ... hence their widespread popularity.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI&#39;ve played sports myself, and I recognize that they served an important role in my own education insofar as they taught me as a child how to work on a team -- a very important lesson!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut, as an adult, I&#39;ve honestly struggled with games more broadly.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd perhaps that is in some ways a good thing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere can be no doubt that sports help many people to escape from what may otherwise be a mundane existence.  But, at the end of the game, those who have mundane existences have not truly altered their mundane situation one bit.  The world within which the game occurs remains almost completely unaffected.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd that&#39;s part of the reason why I&#39;ve traditionally had a problem with most types of games -- because they&#39;re just too removed from the realities of my own life to heavily invest my time.  I want to live an interesting life -- one which results in some sort of exciting change which takes the world to a new, exciting place.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere must be others out there who feel the same, but I&#39;ve yet to see somebody confirm it.  As far as I can tell, I&#39;m in a small minority of people who just don&#39;t see any point to games.  I prefer the real world.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut, when I go to a bar and look up, what I see is a basketball game.  Or, when I hang out with friends, they ask me if I watched the baseball game last night.  Or, when I go home for the holidays, my parents have left the football game on the television all weekend long.  I&#39;ve long since learned to not wear the local team shirt, for fear that a well-intentioned fan might start talking to me about &quot;the game&quot;.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eAn Alternative Future\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen I watch these sports shows, there&#39;s a hypothetical future which every time comes to mind.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSay you are sitting in your apartment on a Sunday afternoon.  You flip on the television, and just as the hundreds of times before, there&#39;s a half-circle of manicured pundits in expensive Armani suits blabbing away.  There&#39;s a ticker at the bottom of the screen ticking off numbers.  There are brief interviews by journalists &quot;on the field&quot;.  And there are more in-depth stories that tell the emotional life stories of those involved ...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e... with one difference ...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is not a sports channel.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe pundits are talking about scientific controversies.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe ticker at the bottom of the screen informs the viewers of the current wagers for a variety of upcoming science mission results on the science futures market.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Science Futures Market\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/im3GayFgEGr\" class=\"ot-anchor\"\u003ehttps://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/im3GayFgEGr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe journalist &quot;on the field&quot; is interviewing people directly involved with the mission, as well as critics of textbook theory who are explaining why their wagers will defy the odds.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd the emotional life stories remind us of how far we&#39;ve come to this new (hypothetical) reality from a former era where science mavericks were en masse ridiculed.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eScience Journalism as Sports Journalism\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eJohn Burnham seems to think that at least in one sense, science journalism is already halfway there ...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI have to admit that I did not entirely come up with this odd idea myself.  It comes from Burnham&#39;s surprising analysis in \u003ci\u003eHow Superstition Won and Science Lost: Popularizing Science and Health in the United States\u003c/i\u003e ...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Science Journalist\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/4JJvZu18D9L\" class=\"ot-anchor\"\u003ehttps://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/4JJvZu18D9L\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&quot;A structural element in news reporting also intensified the sensationalism issue in science popularization throughout the twentieth century.  Journalistic reports almost always started with conclusions and implications and then were filled out with supporting detail -- \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eexactly the opposite format from the restrained scientific report in which conclusions and discussions came only after the methodology and findings were fully set forth. The news format therefore put great emphasis on the journalists&#39; interpretations. The whole problem was exacerbated by the fact that news items tended to be short -- in contrast to the longer magazine format -- and so journalists cut the scientific context at the same time that they played up attention-grabbing elements and products.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Again, a combination of sensationalism with the briefly stated facts removed science news substantially from older standards of responsible popularizing.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat was new in twentieth-century popularizing of science and health, then, was not sensationalism but the bits-and-pieces format\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, and the early to mid-century timing of the coming of journalists and their format explains when and why they had such an impact.  Journalism itself, as Michael Schudson has pointed out, developed, around the 1930s especially, a strategy to strive for objectivity, whereby fact and opinion were separated -- opinion to go into signed columns and objective fact into the news columns. This development, Schudson shows, was the end product of the nineteenth-century belief in objective reality, when the daily flow of events came to constitute a reality in itself. For most news, then, the interpretive signed column served to provide a context, so that the endless flow of bits and pieces was at least given a place within the socio-political world of the journalists.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFor science and health, however, only half of this journalistic strategy was effective. By and large, columnists in those fields, when such columns existed, merely multiplied facts -- as typically, and best known, in the health columns of newspapers or in Science Service syndications. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSuch columnists did not provide context. And ordinary journalistic columnists were not competent to act the part of men of science. The only interpreters of science who had any impact, then, were the advertisers. *The result was that sports journalism became the most recognizable model for all reporting, including science and health -- a kaleidoscope, as Gilman Ostrander puts it, &#39;a jarring and distracting montage of unrelated pictures and news items and advertisements, all competing for attention and most of them immediately forgotten.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Science, health, and psychology were incidental elements in this twentieth-century torrent of items, and when they occurred in a sensationalistic guide, they became just one of the &#39;tremendous trifles,&#39; media fads that Frederick Lews Allen described as characteristic of the 1920s -- \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003einsignificant items given emotional appeal, rapidly becoming known to everyone who shared the mass media world and then passing into oblivion.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e (236-237)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eA Future We Could Choose to Have\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Controversies of Science collection has to-date covered around 40 ongoing controversies.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFor those who have followed along, I am betting there is a sense with at least some of you that at least some of these controversies will eventually upset their textbook counterparts.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere remain many more we&#39;ve yet to get to.  But, the sad fact is that most of these challenges remain completely unknown to the scientific community.  There of course is no controversy channel, just as there currently is no legal science futures market (at least in the United States ... yet).  And without any infrastucture which makes the controversial cutting edge of science interesting and meaningful to the public, we should be real about our prospects for progress on these innovation bottlenecks.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSome would say that all we can do is wait for scientists to die.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eI find that grim and the least creative course of action possible to us: Let&#39;s do nothing ... and wait.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf &quot;the game&quot; was an actual debate about actual science, then when &quot;the game&quot; is over, the world would have undergone some identifiable change.  With each &quot;game&quot;, we&#39;d in theory at least be a step closer to a more scientific future.  If it was to culturally catch on, we cannot even in our current reality begin to grasp the new pace of innovation which might transpire.  All sorts of things which had been assumed to be a hundred years off might suddenly look possible on much shorter timescales.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut, the current reality is that the ongoing progress in science today occurs out of our own ability to participate in it, behind the closed doors of experts fully invested in the old ideas.  They direct science according to their own, older conception of where it should go.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eAnd we sit and we passively wait for an exciting scientific future.  And in the meantime, there are plenty of &quot;real&quot; games to watch on tv.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eGo team!\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23culture\"\u003e#culture\u003c/a\u003e       \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23future\"\u003e#future\u003c/a\u003e    \ufeff",

At one time, the task of popular science had been to clear up mysteries.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Indeed, as late as 1924, Slosson, the voice of Science Service, was still denouncing false beliefs and commercial distortions by saying that &#39;the test of real science&#39; was &#39;its honesty&#39; in attacking &#39;the real mysteries of nature.&#39;  Explanation was for him, as it had been earlier for &#39;men of science,&#39; the essence of popularizing. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut by the midcentury period, popularizers of all varieties were bemoaning the fact that pure science had become so complicated that they could hardly explain it. The science of the new century did not necessarily confirm the gospel of certain progress, unity, and reductionism of an earlier day.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Biologist Francis Sumner of the University of California in 1937 summarized the dilemma for example of those who read about the new physics: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;There would seem to be a vast inconsistency between the traditional notion of the man of science, with his uncompromising insistence on evidence and his lofty scorn of guesses and unproved assumptions, and the quasi-mystic who tells us all these strange things about space and infinity and who describes with such assurance the detailed intricacies of an infinitesimal world forever beyond the range of human observation.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhile innumerable newspapermen of the 1920s tried to explain relativity, and in later years other baffling ideas, or to explain why something could not be explained, only a few scientists attempted to draw conclusions for the public from the unsettling findings of the new physics and other mathematical or abstract studies. Popularizers of every stripe found themselves instead portraying confusion. They therefore often had to readjust what they were doing, because they could no longer appeal to the paradigmatic act of explaining the mystery. They were, rather, being called upon to explain the confusion, which was particularly difficult without the vision of ultimate unity that earlier popularizers had enjoyed and exploited.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e The newspapers were not to blame, instead the editor of the New York Times in 1935: &#39;The function of the newspaper is primarily to report what the leading scientists do and say.  If they contradict each other, and there is confusion, the newspapers merely picture the confusion and do not create it.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe result of this challenge to the unity of science was to encourage popularizers to redouble the emphasis that had been developing on portraying the results, rather than the ideas, of science.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e The Science Year Book published in the 1940s, for example, usually had &#39;aviation&#39; as a major category and consisted almost entirely of articles about applied science developments.  As early as 1903, W.S. Franklin, a physicist at Lehigh, observed: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;Everything that appears in the name of science in our newspapers and magazines relates only to results. Have any of you seen in our newspapers or popular magazines any detailed description of the principles and methods used by Marconi in his wireless telegraphy?&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e More than half a century later, Palmer Wright, a Dow Chemical chemist, wondered if popularizers should not build on applied science for understanding. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;The popular thrust,&#39; he observed, &#39;is toward the what, not the why of science.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSo it was that popularized science in the twentieth century continued as in the nineteenth to emphasize progress -- \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ebut progress now in terms more exclusively of the &#39;applications mankind can make from [the] marvelous findings&#39; of &#39;pure science,&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e as a 1926 writer put it.  But the new context of progress had further implications.  Any facts at all could be digested into the popular science of results; \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethey needed no further context than that they were part of the advance of science. Thus a discovery at any level of science reported in the 1920s was a fact and a part of the progress of science;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e so, too, was a machine of the 1930s or a cure of the 1940s a fact and a part of the progress of science.  This approach to popularizing was compatible with the rise of general science in the schools, in which teachers emphasized application and turned away from the work of researchers that was abstract and unpopular. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eEven in the 1960s, reported Howard E. Gruber, &#39;high school teachers generally approach[ed] science teaching as a matter of conveying science as established facts and doctrines&#39; rather than &#39;science teaching in which science [was] treated as a way of thought.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e In the more general popularizing of the twentieth century, audiences would have been lucky to get doctrines in addition to lists of products.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e (p214-216)\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBurnham&#39;s critique seems to challenge our simplistic notions of what a paradigm change would look like.  \u003cb\u003eIn a world where science journalists have already been reporting on the what rather than the why for a full century, the knowledge structures constructed in the minds of the consumers of that information do not trace back to reasons to believe; they trace back to an authority -- perhaps even as vaguely defined as just &#39;scientists say&#39;\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is a world where we are dependent upon the experts for any announcement of our new paradigm; \u003cb\u003eyet, the experts are the very people who stand to lose the most by such an announcement.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSo, what is the answer to our question ...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat would a paradigm change actually look like?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct answer is that, assuming you&#39;re not an actual academic with some insight into the inner world of academia, \u003cb\u003ethere&#39;s no real guarantee that you&#39;d actually see our new paradigm emerging at all.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet that thought settle in.  Feel it.  Think about what it means to live in a time where if there was some exciting new scientific era just around the corner, we&#39;d never know it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf you can get the seriousness of this problem, then you already understand the motive for the invention of the controversy campaign.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Controversy Campaign\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eConsider the precedent set by Wikipedia ...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eBuilding Successful Online Communities: Evidence-Based Social Design\u003c/i\u003e, by Robert E. Kraut and Paul Resnick\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&quot;WikiProjects, where groups of editors in Wikipedia organize to improve articles in a defined domain area, use goals organized into what they call &#39;Collaborations of the Week.&#39;  These encourage project members to work on specific high-priority articles.  The project chooses one or two articles under its purview and advertises that editors should improve them during a defined time period (typically a week).  These collaborations of the week are highly successful.  They cause project members in particular to triple the work they do on the designated articles during the collaboration period (see figure 2.7).  The motivational effects of these goals also spill over, causing project members to do ore project-related work generally, editing articles beyond those listed in the collaboration of the week.  In particular, people who have participated in collaborations of the week then go on to engage in what organizational scholars call &#39;organizational citizenship behavior,&#39; those behaviors vital to group functioning that aren&#39;t explicit parts of people&#39;s job descriptions.  For example, in Wikpedia, in contrast with tasks like editing the main body of the articles, citizenship behaviors include fighting vandalism, maintenance work, and clean-up work. (Wilson, Straus, and McEvily 2006).&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA controversy campaign might look somewhat similar -- but with some interesting twists ...\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA campaign on a controversy site would be used to fill out the controversy graph on a particular topic of upcoming relevance.  The controversy graph is the map of all pertinent information related to a debate: crucial concepts, questions, claims, even speculations, arguments and their rebuttals, models, assumptions and the big picture of the clash of worldviews.  This is not simply a collection of raw resources; it&#39;s things like annotations, which very quickly focus a person onto which part of that resource is relevant for some claim.  The idea is, simply put: \u003cb\u003eHow can we eliminate the costly investment in time and research necessary that some future person must do in order to achieve the understanding that we &#39;now&#39; have?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eA controversy campaign, in other words, would fill out the controversy on both sides with a &quot;map&quot;.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eCampaigns to Support Wagers\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut, there&#39;s one more reason why we&#39;d want to direct the entire community to a particular upcoming controversy: to support the creation of well-informed wagers on a science futures market.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Science Futures Market\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/im3GayFgEGr\" class=\"ot-anchor\"\u003ehttps://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/im3GayFgEGr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eRecall that a science futures market is a form of decision market where people can wager bets on well-crafted, specific, time-limited scientific predictions.  Science futures markets have the potential to expose scientific dogma that&#39;s become embedded within science journalism.  They can help us to identify impending paradigm changes, as \u003cb\u003ethey reward those who are paying attention sufficient to understand that the data is deviating from the carefully-managed message we get from mainstream science.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn other words, the science futures market solves the problem that&#39;s been created by the science journalism reporting.  It removes this obstacle that stands between the public and some impending hypothetical paradigm.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eLet&#39;s say that a mission is about to collect its first data, and we want to support the creation of wagers on some known controversy which relates to this mission.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThere would be a special focus on that controversy during a defined period of time -- a controversy campaign. During this campaign, relevant specialists would on occasion be paid by the social network to make themselves available.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe thing about this, of course, is that their time would be limited.

This pilot also happened to be a biology teacher at the University of Minnesota, a subject Paul knew little about. Paul, being inquisitive, began questioning the pilot on the nature of biology. He began using the tools of critical thinking to probe the foundations of the field, asking questions like ‘what is the purpose of biology?’ ‘what are some of the main assumptions biologists make?’ ‘what are some key questions biologists routinely consider?’ ‘what kinds of information do biologists pursue, and how do they determine its quality?’ ‘what are the most fundamental concepts necessary for understanding biological thought?’ ‘how do biologists tend to view the world?’ ‘what are some inferences biologists make as a result of this viewpoint?’ After about 30 minutes in which Paul continually questioned the pilot Socratically (by following the implications of each answer given), the pilot stopped the process. He said ‘you know, what’s really interesting about the questions you’re asking is that some of them would be answered in the first day of an introductory biology course, and some of them could be the focus of PhD dissertations’.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe social network would be set up to permit people to rate each others&#39; questions and questioning styles.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThink carefully about what is going on here.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThis is regular laypeople directly participating in the process of scientific discovery and analysis by aggregating information and argumentation -- essentially doing research -- on important, challenged scientific qestions.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIf ever there was a system which could teach critical thinking and authentically thinking like a scientist ... not just thinking what scientists think, but true, deep, purposeful scientific thinking ... this is it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23paradigmchange\"\u003e#paradigmchange\u003c/a\u003e           \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23sciencejournalism\"\u003e#sciencejournalism\u003c/a\u003e           \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23crowdsourcing\"\u003e#crowdsourcing\u003c/a\u003e      \ufeff",

One of the speakers was Dr. Rush Cosgrove of the Critical Thinking Institute.  His talk on how to teach critical thinking with annotations played some part in my own evolving notions of an annotation library, but so many things have happened since then, that the paper he handed me became lost in my stack of post-its and social network sketches.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eToday, I brought a little bit of order to those notes, and I ran into the paper.  I immediately read it.  It seems to me that this is not something which a person can -- without effort, initially -- just pick up.

This pilot also happened to be a biology teacher at the University of Minnesota, a subject Paul knew little about. Paul, being inquisitive, began questioning the pilot on the nature of biology. He began using the tools of critical thinking to probe the foundations of the field, asking questions like ‘what is the purpose of biology?’ ‘what are some of the main assumptions biologists make?’ ‘what are some key questions biologists routinely consider?’ ‘what kinds of information do biologists pursue, and how do they determine its quality?’ ‘what are the most fundamental concepts necessary for understanding biological thought?’ ‘how do biologists tend to view the world?’ ‘what are some inferences biologists make as a result of this viewpoint?’ After about 30 minutes in which Paul continually questioned the pilot Socratically (by following the implications of each answer given), the pilot stopped the process. He said ‘you know, what’s really interesting about the questions you’re asking is that some of them would be answered in the first day of an introductory biology course, and some of them could be the focus of PhD dissertations’.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis is an example of highly effective intellectual communication. By questioning in a disciplined manner, using a small set of universal analytical tools, Paul had begun to enter into the logic, the system, of biology. In just twenty minutes, he was beginning to ask questions like a biologist, to think like a biologist.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis essay explores the idea of intellectual communication and its improvement through the development of a shared academic language based on these and other universal analytical and evaluative concepts.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIntellectual Communications and Miscommunications\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIntellectual communications abound in academia. Researchers must communicate the status of their work at numerous stages: during initial grant applications, when obtaining permission or access, within publications and to reviewers, in presentations to other academics or to the public. Teaching involves communicating to students through syllabi and assignment descriptions, during class and in office hours or tutorials; and again to administrators, department heads, or deans regarding publications as well as teaching successes and struggles, progress and development. Students, for their part, must communicate to professors their puzzlement and confusions during class time and after, as well as the extent of their understanding during exams and tests.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eYet many of these communications are not successfully received and understood by their intended audience, leading to much wasted time and energy. For instance, students are often confused about what is being asked of them. Indeed, recent broad-scale studies (see e.g., Casner-Lotto and Benner, 2006; and especially Arum and Roksa, 2011) support prominent scholars (see e.g., Bloom, 1988; Bok, 2006; Ramsden, 2007) who have long argued that many students complete their undergraduate degree without learning much at all, and with very little development of their critical capacities. Taken as an aggregate of professor and student time across the nation (or world, if you like), this represents hundreds of thousands of hours of ‘wasted’ time each year.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnd, of course, misunderstanding is not exclusive to students. The overwhelming majority of teachers find it hard to identify objective standards for assessing thought (Paul, Elder, and Bartell, 1997; Thomas, 1999) and to communicate them to their students (for review, see Black and William, 1998, and; James et al., 2006). \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOne implication of this is that much evaluation of students’ written work is grounded in highly subjective and personal criteria, such as the degree of ‘flair and sparkle’\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e (see, e.g. Paul, 1995).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnalysis and Evaluation: Fundamental to Successful Communication\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSuccessful communication depends upon effective analysis and evaluation of thought. That is, in every case in which humans are confronted with something requiring intellectual processing (an essay, a lecture, an assignment, a research publication, etc.), they must break it down to focus on individual parts (analysis) and then they must determine the extent to which those parts make sense or have validity (evaluation).\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis can be seen clearly when applied to written work: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethere is no way to take in an entire book or a page or a paragraph all at once. Operating simultaneously during analysis is the process of evaluation: once readers have determined the meaning behind a section they’ve focused on, they then begin to judge the extent to which that meaning is valuable or true. As you critically read this chapter, you are doing these precise things -- analyzing what you are reading and assessing it for quality, taking it apart to understand it, deciding what to accept and what to reject, relating the ideas within it to other ideas you already have about education and learning, and so on.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOf course, there are many forms of analysis and evaluation. I’ve just discussed one: argument analysis. We might also analyze and evaluate this essay grammatically: noting some interesting uses of punctuation and a bizarre combination of British and American spelling. Or perhaps from a gender studies perspective: noting an absence of gendered pronouns in examples being used.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSubject Specific Forms of Analysis and Evaluation\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn fact, there are myriad forms of analysis and evaluation. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eEach discipline has at least one, and many have more. These subject specific forms are often highly specialized and unique: biologists are interested in the extent to which an experiment has been controlled and can be repeated; historians are not. Art critics focus on brush stroke and use of color; psychologists don’t. Basketball coaches care about wrist flick and arm extension. Poets think about word choice and rhyme structure. Anthropologists are concerned with interpretation bias.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThough this is not often made explicit, much of our success or failure within academia is due to our ability or inability to become conversant in these scholarly languages and dialects, and thus to communicate in appropriate ways to colleagues, mentors, and students. In other words, people are considered skilled in a subject, not usually by measuring the number of ‘facts’ they can regurgitate (though this often forms the basis of low-level assessment) but by the extent to which they can read and interpret (i.e. analyze and evaluate) texts or other intellectual communications in the field, and then produce unique and creative syntheses which are clear, accurate, and logical (among other important criteria); conditions which are tested at higher levels of examination, such as PhD dissertations.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSubject specific forms of analysis and evaluation are important and useful. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThey represent systems which serve to ensure (or at least improve) quality of thought within the discipline.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e They have developed slowly over time, often in response to previous abuses which were recognized as problematic (e.g. the creation of ethical guidelines in medical research due to unethical actions taken by researchers), or to correct common mistakes in the field (e.g. not controlling for variables in the sciences and social sciences).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHowever, subject-specific forms of analysis and evaluation are also limited in important ways: because each is unique, it is not transferrable to other fields or disciplines; because each is complex, often requiring the absorption of a large vocabulary, students must spend many weeks or years reading and working in a particular field before they develop skill enough to contribute to its discourse, and most will never attain nor are interested in attaining such a level [2]. Further, these specialized languages necessarily exclude those who do not speak them.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis exclusion tends to increase as one gets closer to primary research; \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003emuch of what is published is readable by only a small fraction of humanity, which renders impotent many important insights and implications for human action and societal development\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e (for instance, how many fundamental and fairly simple yet powerful ideas have you studied which are not widely understood or employed, with negative implications for individuals or society?) \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThese important insights are not successfully communicated to students and the public because they require knowledge and skill in specific forms of analysis and evaluation, which many readers lack.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eFortunately, underneath these specialized forms of discourse, and fundamental to effective functioning within any discipline, lies a universal set of analytical and evaluative concepts; a set which is sometimes called the ‘critical-analytical vocabulary’. This vocabulary, being based in common language (e.g. English, French, Japanese, Arabic), is accessible to all.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e In other words, it forms the basis of a vocabulary that can be shared by all people in human societies; it can be developed and expanded in an effort to improve the efficiency and success of intellectual communications wherever they exist.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe next two sections briefly explore some of these analytical and evaluative tools, and the manner in which they implicitly operate in human thinking, wherever and whenever humans think.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eUniversal Analytical Language\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eI will now make an assertion which may seem controversial, but bear with me for a moment: despite the unlimited potential manifestations of human thinking, there are universal elements of thought which are always present, and which are therefore always subject to inquiry. Further, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eif one understands that disciplines do not exist as bodies of collected facts but as forms of thinking about the world in specific directions, one will see that each subject can be probed at a fundamental and powerful level through its system of thought.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThink back to the story which begins this essay. How was Paul able to enter into a subject about which he knew very little in such a short time? The answer lies in his understanding of human thinking and therefore human thinking regarding specific subjects: he knew that certain structures form the basis of every discipline, and so knew he had a ready set of analytical questions with which he could investigate this new (to him) system of thought (biology).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePaul and Elder call these fundamental structures the ‘Elements of Thought’, and generally place them into a circle diagram to emphasize the non-linear nature of the relationships between and among them. These structures are not proceduralized, but are based on principles which can be ordered in many possible ways for many possible purposes. To my mind, they form a starting point for the development of a universal analytical language:&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[See Large Diagram]\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&quot;Paul and Elder argue that the elements of thought are present wherever human thinking is present, and therefore suggest a minimal set of questions which could be asked while performing any intellectual analysis.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e One can, for example, question the purpose of studying history or of car buying. One might seek out information for preparing for a nursing exam as well as for making a political decision. There are implications for being a highly skilled teacher just as there are for being a loving and supportive parent. Furthermore, these elements interact in the mind in an integrated way. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf your purpose changes (teaching elementary students versus teaching college students), then so too will your questions, and therefore the information you seek, the conclusions you come to or the inferences you make, etc.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnother way to consider the universality of these structures can be seen in the absurdity of their negation; that is, it would be unintelligible to say of one’s own reasoning that it is without a purpose, asks no questions, is based on no information, leads to no implications, embodies no point of view, begins with no assumptions, employs no concepts, and comes to no conclusions.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Further, to claim that these structures are not universal is a conclusion (inference) which is based on some information and in response to a problem; it employs concepts filtered through the lens of particular assumptions contained within a point of view; it seeks to accomplish a goal (purpose) and leads to implications and consequences. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn other words, to negate them is to use or presuppose them -- and thus to prove that they are implicit in reasoning.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn an academic subject, these elements can be applied on multiple levels. To introduce students to a subject, for example, one might begin with a discussion of the elements of reasoning at the heart of the subject, as in: some important purposes of engineering are ... some key questions engineers ask are ... engineers tend to gather the following types of information ... engineers make the following types of inferences ... engineering is founded on certain assumptions regarding the nature of the world, such as ... some key concepts central to engineering, without which one would not be able to understand it are ... some implications of skilled engineering reasoning versus unskilled engineering reasoning might be ... engineers tend to view the world as follows ... One might substitute any subject or human activity for &#39;engineering&#39; above (e.g. history, anthropology, teaching a course, teaching an individual class, reading an essay or speech, etc. etc.) and these analytical tools will, I believe, prove valid and useful.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOf course, these are not the only possible universal analytical concepts. One theoretician, Gerald Nosich (2009), has proposed a ninth: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003econtext\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHe presents all nine together by putting a box around the circle of elements, with the word ‘context’ in the corners, implying that human thinking always exists within a particular context.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e There are possibly more structures which are universal in their application, and as the field of critical thinking continues to emerge it will be important for more scholars to contribute their own ideas and suggestions regarding universal as well as subject specific forms of analysis and evaluation. Linda Elder makes such an appeal in her contribution to this collection.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eUniversal Evaluative Language\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn addition to these analytical tools lies a group of fundamental intellectual standards which are essential, to varying degrees, in every discipline. Paul and Elder (2002) offer the following list of what they term &#39;essential intellectual standards.&#39;&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[See Small Diagram]\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&quot;One can easily see the usefulness of this list to teaching and learning, and indeed to thinking generally. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut Elder and Paul point out that the above is far from complete, and have explored and developed a more extensive, but still not exhaustive, conception of intellectual standards in the Thinkers’ Guide to Intellectual Standards\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e (2009). For example, one can readily see the importance of intellectual standards such as sufficiency, validity, reasonability, consistency and so on.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePeople skilled in adhering to intellectual standards can determine the quality of intellectual communications by asking the following types of questions, contextualized, for example, when reading an article: &#39;To what extent are the central parts of this argument clear; to what extent are they muddy or vague (clarity)?&#39; &#39;How accurate is the information used in this report (accuracy)?&#39; &#39;Is there an adequate amount of detail in examples used(precision)?&#39; &#39;Does the author deal with the complexities in the issue, or is the issue treated superficially (depth)?&#39; &#39;Has the author considered alternative viewpoints, or given an overly narrow account (breadth)?&#39; &#39;To what extent is this specific example pertinent to the argument (relevance)?&#39; &#39;How important is this issue (significance)?&#39; &#39;Is the argument coherent, or does it have internal inconsistencies (logic)?&#39; &#39;to what extent is the author using manipulative language or other intellectual trickery to convince the reader that the argument is sound (fairness)?&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOf course, the standards require some degree of interpretation during contextualization.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e That is, accuracy in a biology experiment is not the same as accuracy in interpreting an essay. The same goes for depth: one might consider multiple societal forces and their effects on a particular event in the study of history or one might look for multiple variables leading to mental illness when reasoning psychologically. In some cases it may seem that one or more standard is not relevant to a discipline at all (e.g. ‘breadth’ in architecture); however, in my experience this is usually resolved upon deeper reflection [3] (e.g. ‘have you considered the viewpoints of those who will be living or working in the building? Of the builders? Of the neighbors?).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs with the elements of reasoning, arguments against the importance of intellectual standards in human thought are implicitly based on those very criteria. For instance, they imply at minimum that the argument is clear and accurate. Further, can you imagine a professor or professional saying &#39;what we want in our field is people who routinely think unclearly, inaccurately, imprecisely, superficially, without regard to complexity, narrow-mindedly, illogically, and unfairly&#39;?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnalytical and Evaluative Fluency\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis analytical and evaluative language is intuitive (few would argue against the importance of their usage). \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eYet how fluent are we in its use or in the use of any analytic and evaluative language? Extant research is not inspiring. For example, in the studies conducted by Paul, Elder, and Bartell (1997) and Thomas (1999), only 8% of professors interviewed were able to enumerate any intellectual criteria required of students [4], and over 90% of faculty could not distinguish between an inference and an assumption, or between an inference and an implication. It may come as no surprise, then, that the new and highly visible report Academically Adrift (Arum and Roksa, 2011), finds that students’ ability to effectively analyze and evaluate is generally poor, and that these skills do not increase much during their college years (during which 45% of students demonstrate no statistically significant gains in critical thinking).\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThus, teachers’ good intentions are often not successfully communicated to students.

Further, though forms of analysis and evaluation differ from subject to subject, there are universal forms which are fundamental to all disciplines; and that the groundwork for this ‘critical-analytical vocabulary’, or shared academic language, has been established by Paul and Elder in the intellectual constructs termed the ‘Elements of Thought’ and the ‘Universal Intellectual Standards’. Finally, despite our good intentions, we humans are not, with few exceptions, fluent or disciplined in the language of analysis and evaluation, universal or otherwise.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eImmediately following is an exploration of some possibilities which explicit adoption of a common academic language might create.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat would adoption of a common academic language look like in an ideal world?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eLet us now consider a hypothetical university in which virtually all students and faculty are fluent in a universal analytical and evaluative language, focusing for the moment on important implications for teaching and learning. In this imaginary institution the logic of each course is identified from the very beginning in the syllabus: its purposes and key questions, core concepts and main sources of information, important assumptions and implications, as well as the central perspective (or perspectives) which will be explored or developed. Students, being sensitive to the elements of thought, are readily able to read and digest the basic logic of the course, even if they have never before studied the subject (as Paul did with biology, using the elements of thought). Students come to class with questions about these fundamental structures -- how are they different from or similar to those within subjects and fields which they already understand? What unique structures will be considered during the course?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTeachers are ready to respond to these questions and are comfortable helping students make connections with other disciplines, since their own fluency in this common academic language has allowed them to probe the structures of surrounding as well as distant fields of understanding (again, as Paul did). Further, they make clear their intentions with the course: the grounds upon which students will be evaluated; the skills and dispositions they will be expected to exhibit or develop. Students understand these communications, as they are accustomed to discussing analysis and evaluation and possess well-developed vocabularies for both; they are knowledgeable about these processes generally, as well as experienced in their engagement in multiple forms.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eConsequently, the quality of student papers and student thinking is generally high. Though differences certainly still exist, few student papers contain wildly irrelevant or flagrantly inaccurate statements. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eStudents are cognizant of what to look for in their own writing and, by the time they graduate, have years of experience of explicit and informed self-reflection (itself entailing analysis and evaluation). Due to this experience, these students take constructive critique well, and understand that their writing and reasoning can always improve.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eStudents graduate with fundamental and long-term understandings of the basic logic of various disciplines. They are explicitly aware of both universal as well as subject specific forms of analysis and evaluation, and they are ready to apply these to further study or in work settings; finally, students are flexible and experienced in learning new systems, so they can more readily enter into whatever novel and/or unique forms of analysis and evaluation they encounter throughout their professional and personal lives.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat does this look like in reality?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe above ideal may never be achieved, certainly not in the near-future. However, schools and universities across the United States and beyond are beginning to take critical thinking more seriously, and are working to integrate its analytical and evaluative language into their courses and curricula. One such institution is currently attempting to infuse the ‘elements of thought’ and ‘universal intellectual standards’ across the curriculum. Some faculty are attesting to powerful change, and to the benefits of a shared academic vocabulary. For example, consider this highly reflective and self-aware comment from one professor after being introduced to the elements and standards and using them in her classroom:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;I think that for decades I have given my students many opportunities to engage in critical thinking, and I have modeled critical thinking in class discussions. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut I don&#39;t think I can claim ever to have taught critical thinking in a systematic way.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e [The Elements of Thought and Intellectual Standards] give me a way to share a critical thinking vocabulary with students and to chart their progress. I know and can tell my students exactly what I am looking for.&#39; -- Spring 2008 Pilot Program Participant, Department of English\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe first sentence represents the thoughts of the vast majority of teachers, 97% of whom claim critical thinking to be of primary importance and who further claim to be developing it in their students (Gardiner, 1995; Paul, Elder, and Bartell, 1997; Thomas, 1999). Of course, most teachers believe they are teaching for critical thinking and most probably are providing some opportunity for students to think critically; \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ehowever, because the overwhelming majority of faculty (roughly 80%) are not fluent in the language of analysis and evaluation, and so do not discuss analytical and evaluative concepts explicitly with their students, most of this opportunity is wasted, the time instead filled with uncritical discussion and reaction.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAfter being introduced to the ‘elements’ and ‘standards’, this professor began to integrate them into her course in a systematic way. On the next page is an example of how she used this language to communicate with her students more explicitly and clearly regarding the analysis and evaluation of historical texts. Notice that she has added one subject-specific analytical concept: ‘techniques’.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThere is some indication that explicitly communicating this language to students can lead to improved student reasoning. For example, contrast the student responses from Oxford undergraduates regarding evaluation with this response from a student four years their junior, but who has been introduced explicitly to the intellectual standards (Cosgrove, 2010):\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eRC: so as you can see from the stuff that you’ve read, what I’m focused on is critical thinking -- has your teacher talked to you about critical thinking?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e(Students laughing, lots of &#39;yeahs&#39;)\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eStudent: yeah he loves his critical thinking. The concepts are wide right. Like &#39;breadth, how wide does the argument go? Depth, how deep does it go? Specific, precision, accuracy&#39; all of that, all the time. (laughing)\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eRC: so what does he have you do with these ideas?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eStudent: just so when you write, and also when you read. So when you read a source &#39;how deep does this go? Is this just skimming the surface or is it a deep in-depth opinion?&#39; when you write &#39;are you just writing briefly or are you writing deep points?&#39; and accuracy is something, on exams you need to be accurate, so that’s a good thing. Other ones, such as breadth, so how wide do you cover, do you look at different points of view? Or are you being quite limited in your thinking and the way your arguing? So he’s always saying like &#39;don’t forget!&#39; he loves them, he loves them! (laughing)\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis response is far more elaborate and precise than any response from the Oxford undergraduates, as well as 90% of the teachers interviewed by Paul, Elder, and Bartell (1997) and Thomas (1999). Of course, it is imperfect, and we have no evidence that this student uses these ideas effectively when reading or writing. However, he has become explicitly aware of some fundamental and powerful evaluative language and seems to be interested and engaged with the ideas. Further, he is at minimum aware of their potential use, and so is better positioned to employ them in his thinking.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThese are but a few of the ways in which the Elements of Thought and Universal Intellectual Standards are currently being used to improve intellectual communications between teachers and students. For example, some resources can be found in the handbooks provided by the Foundation for Critical Thinking, which contain dozens of sample course designs and assignments from every major subject for k-12 education (see, e.g. Paul et al., 2008). Further guidance can be found in Gerald Nosich’s (2009) Learning to Think Things Through: A Guide to Critical Thinking Across the Curriculum.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSome Implications for Research\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOf course there are broader implications beyond teaching and learning of a shared academic language. One important direction is that of interdisciplinary research. Currently, much research is confined within a specialized area, and there are relatively few examples of crossdisciplinary research; yet such investigations often produce the most groundbreaking advancements. Further, as world problems are increasingly recognized to be multi-dimensional, researchers are finding it necessary to take a multi-disciplinary approach; an approach which includes team members from different backgrounds who possess varied knowledge and skill sets. One such example is climate change research, which necessitates integrating insights from such disparate disciplines as ecology, chemistry, climatology, biology, meteorology, and physics. Another example is that of drug rehabilitation, which again requires insights from psychology, history, neuroscience, and sociology.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf effective research is to be done regarding climate change or drug rehabilitation, must individuals then become experts in all these fields? \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eEven if we had the inclination and potential, the time required makes this highly impractical. Yet the critical-analytical vocabulary offers the possibility for experts to communicate complex ideas in a universal language which is understood by all members of a research team.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Such communication could, would, and should, be done creatively; yet a simple way to start would be to produce the ‘logic’ (again, which includes all the elements of thought) of a given aspect of the project to all participating researchers. Thus, each would be able to grasp the basic ideas and findings fairly quickly, and could then integrate them into their own specialized thinking and planning.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eA similar approach (using the elements of thought to structure a summary of research) could be taken in the presentation of findings to the public: by using common language which is more accessible, researchers might better bridge the gap that often separates academic research from public understanding, acceptance, and implementation.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSummary and Conclusion\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTo summarize: if we look at the academic world as intense with intellectual communications, we see that much is lost in translation between people skilled in different forms of analysis and evaluation. Some of this difference is necessary and helpful; however much of it is counterproductive. I see in the critical-analytical vocabulary of the English language [5] the potential for an academic lingua Franca which could significantly improve communications between teachers, students, researchers, and the public. This article has laid out some of these possibilities.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat, then, are some important implications of this argument? The first is that we need to think and talk about analytical and evaluative language more explicitly in general. Every field should discuss and consider the important forms of analysis and evaluation central to that discipline, and these should be communicated to students clearly and routinely. Indeed, the ‘Assessment for Learning’ and ‘Learning how to Learn’ (Black and William, 1998; James et al., 2006) projects encouraged faculty to do just this and achieved significant learning improvements as a result.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eMore immediately, and perhaps more easily, individuals and communities should increase their fluency in the universal language of analysis and evaluation. If we are to communicate effectively with each other, if we are to understand thoughts and ideas that are presently beyond us, we must improve our ability to analyze and evaluate those communications. The ‘elements of thought’ and ‘universal intellectual standards’ provide us with resilient tools to improve our efforts in this direction. If this vocabulary seems to you intuitive, begin to experiment with it more explicitly in your intellectual communications. Then, finally, after a rich diversity of applications of these elements and standards to a range of intellectual systems, judge for yourself whether they contribute to the power and enrichment of your students’ (and your own) intellectual work.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eFootnotes\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[2] That is, most students of most classes will not become professionals in that particular field.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[3] This statement is not meant to be all-encompassing.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[4] The Paul et. al.

A Little History\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn 1886, Heinrich Hertz accidentally constructed the first radio transmitter and receiver. In a darkened lecture theater at the Technical College in Karlsruhe, in Germany, Hertz had set up an experiment to test what happened when an electrical current flowed in an open circuit (that is, a circuit with a gap in it). \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs he explained the setup to his wife, Elisabeth, he switched on a spark generator, used to produce current, and one of them noticed a simultaneous spark that flashed in an unrelated piece of equipment at some distance away from his main experimental apparatus. Whoever noticed it first, Heinrich or Elisabeth, is unknownto us, but it was Heinrich who made the leap of curiosities that underscore the nature of scientific research. Hertz asked &#39;Why?&#39; and started a systematic search for an answer.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eEighty years later historians of science would report that Hertz was at least the sixth physicist to see this odd effect, but he was the first to follow up on his key question.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e He proceeded to design a series of brilliantly simple experiments, one after another, in search of an answer. He was able to show that an invisible form of radiation, which he called &#39;electric waves,&#39; carried energy through intervening space. Hertz was also able to demonstrate that the electric waves were a phenomenon very similar to light. In fact their speed through the air was the same as that of light. Today we know that both light and Hertz’s &#39;electric waves&#39; are forms of electromagnetic radiation (see Appendix A.2). Over time, the Hertzian waves (a name used very early in the 20th century) came to be called radio waves. Their frequency is measured in cycles per second, now called Hertz (Hz) ...\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eHertz died tragically at the young age of 35 of blood poisoning from an infected tooth. If he hadn’t, he surely would have won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAfter showing that radio waves behave much as light does, except that they are utterly invisible, Hertz did not ask how far they might travel through space. That was left to Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian physicist who performed a series of obsessively creative experiments to prove that radio waves could travel enormous distances and even pass through rock. He was wrong in this latter belief, but he did show that a radio signal could traverse the Atlantic Ocean. The reason that the radio waves made it across despite the curvature of the earth was because the earth’s atmosphere is surrounded by an electrically conductive layer known as the ionosphere and radio waves bounce off that layer to be reflected across the ocean. That wouldn’t be understood until decades later. Meanwhile, Marconi was happy to know that radio waves did go all the way around the earth and it was not long before that ships at sea could signal one another and to their home ports using radio waves. By 1912 the infamous sinking of the Titanic spread awareness that radio transmitters could send an SOS far and wide.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMarconi did wonder whether there might be radio waves reaching earth from space but his equipment would not reveal the existence of the wondrous invisible universe for the same reason that he could signal across the Atlantic. At the low radio frequencies that Marconi used, the reflecting ionosphere not only allows radio signals to bounce around the curvature of the earth, it also prevents radio waves from space from reaching the earth’s surface. Those that do arrive from space are reflected back. (Only if their intrinsic frequency is higher than about 20 MHz such radio waves do reach the ground unimpeded, but then it was not known very much about building receivers at such frequencies.)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e1.2. The Birth of Radio Astronomy\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKarl Guthe Jansky, the father of radio astronomy, was employed at Bell Laboratories, which, in 1927, introduced the first transatlantic radiotelephone. For a mere $75 one could speak for three minutes between New York and London, but the radio links were terribly susceptible to electrical interference. The first system operated at the extraordinarily low frequency of 60 kHz (that is, at the very long wavelength of 5 km) and in 1929 a change was made to short waves whose frequencies were in the range of 10–20 MHz. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut the new telephone links were still susceptible to electrical disturbances of unknown nature, which plagued the connections. Jansky was assigned the task of locating the source of the interference.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e To carry out his studies he built a rotating antenna (Figure 1.1) operating at 20.5 MHz and by 1930 began taking regular observations. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn 1932 he reported that local and distant thunderstorms were two sources of the radio noise and a third source was &#39;a very steady hiss-type static, the origin of which is not yet known.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eDuring the following year he was unambiguously able to demonstrate that the source of the signals was outside the earth and presented a report entitled &#39;electrical disturbances apparently of extraterrestrial origin.&#39; And so radio astronomy was born.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eJust imagine this: When Jansky became convinced he had picked up radio waves from space he enjoyed what few people ever experience -- the thrill of discovery -- seeing something no one had ever seen before. That is part of the reward, the joy, and excitement of doing scientific research.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFifty years later, at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, distinguished radio astronomers gathered to celebrate the anniversary of Jansky’s discovery. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eA report entitled &#39;serendipitous discoveries in radio astronomy&#39; grew out of that meeting and it presents the human side of the birth and growth of this science.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;Serendipity&#39; is a term coined by Horace Walpole, the writer and historian, who used it to refer to the experience of making fortunate and unexpected discoveries, according to the fairy tale about the three princes of Serendip (an old name for Ceylon). \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSerendipitous discoveries are those made by accident, but also by wisdom; however no one can make an accidental discovery unless that person is capable of recognizing that something of significance is occurring. Jansky was such a person.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn January 1934, in a letter to his father, Jansky wrote:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;Have I told you that I now have what I think is definite proof that the waves come from the Milky Way? However, I’m not working on the interstellar waves anymore.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eHis boss had set him to work on matters of more immediate concern, matters, which were:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e... not near as interesting as interstellar waves, nor will it bring near as much publicity. I’m going to do a little theoretical research of my own at home on the interstellar waves, however.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eJansky did not take interest in his new discoveries to the point of building his own antenna so as to pursue his explorations over the weekends. Jansky’s boss, who ruled with an iron hand, was later to encourage him to write another report, and \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ein 1935 Jansky interpreted the sky waves as coming from the entire Milky Way. But he did not know why and suggested that either a lot of stars were contributing or something in interstellar space was the cause. He realized that if the waves were due to stars he should have picked up the sun. As observed from the surface of the earth the Milky Way happens to reach its maximum brightness in the radio band close to Jansky’s chosen frequency. It is brighter at still lower frequencies, but those radio waves do not penetrate the ionosphere. Furthermore, the ionosphere experiences daily changes of its characteristics and in the daytime blocks out the sun’s radio emission. Thus Jansky’s antenna was blind to its radiation. The mid-1930s were also a time of sunspot minimum, which meant that the ionosphere was transparent to 20 MHz at night. Had Jansky been observing at sunspot maximum, the ionosphere, whose reflecting properties vary with time of day and season as well as sunspot cycle, would have blocked out all 20-MHz radio waves from space and he would not have discovered the signals from the Milky Way.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eJansky failed to pursue his discoveries any further because there were other projects to be done and &#39;star noise could come later&#39; he was told by his employers. It was to be years before significant follow-up work began. A few astronomers in the United States and Europe had become aware of Jansky’s work, but any plans to look more closely at his discoveries had to be shelved when World War II broke out. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn any event, most astronomers knew absolutely nothing about radio receivers and antennas, so how could they get involved? Optical astronomers were just not equipped with the skills necessary to tinker with radio sets. After the war it was mostly radio physicists who launched the new science, and they had to learn astronomy in the process.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAfter he made his discovery, Jansky wrote to the famous physicist, Sir Edward Appleton:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;If there is any credit due to me, it is probably for a stubborn curiosity that demanded an explanation for the unknown interference and led me to the long series of recordings necessary for the determination of the actual direction of arrival.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSuch stubborn curiosity is the hallmark of good scientists.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Jansky trusted his data and continued his measurements for confirmation. His persistence led to the discovery that the source of the static lay in the astronomical heavens.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe story of radio astronomy is replete with apparently amazing cases of fortuitous discoveries, but such discoveries [require] more than good luck. They require a prepared mind and dedicated effort to follow up on what might at first have seemed to be a preposterous new observation. What would have been more preposterous, at least back in 1933, than to learn that radio waves were reaching the earth from all sorts of strange astronomical objects, and even from the beginnings of time and space.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e[...]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e2.1.

He failed because the receiver was not sensitive enough. This was the first use of a reflector-type radio telescope. At the Serendipity meeting, Kraus stated that \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003emeaningful accidental discovery occurs only as the result of &#39;being in the right place with the right equipment doing the right experiment at the right time.&#39; Another noted astronomer, R. Hanbury Brown, added that the person should &#39;not know too much,&#39; otherwise the discovery might not be made!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis summarizes a very interesting phenomenon. Many research scientists, especially the theoretically inclined, &#39;know&#39; so much that their chance of making a lucky or creative discovery may be severely curtailed. If we know too much, our vision is sometimes narrowed to the point where new opportunities are not seen. Jansky knew a little astronomy, but not enough for it to get in his way and cause him to reject the possibility that radio waves originating in the cosmos might be real.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eGrote Reber, a professional engineer and radio ham in his spare time, was one of the few people who recognized the interesting implications of Jansky’s discovery. Reber was certainly not hampered by any astronomical prejudices about whether or not the cosmic radio waves could exist. Instead, he was interested in verifying their existence and followed up on Jansky’s work.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e To this end, Reber built the world’s first steerable radio dish antenna (Figure 2.1) in his backyard and mapped the Milky Way radiation during the period 1935–1941. Figure 2.2 shows an example of Reber’s data. He pointed out that \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethe new field of radio astronomy was originally caught between two disciplines.

The new science therefore grew slowly.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e The intrusion of World War II may have speeded up its growth because of the intense research in radar techniques, which led to the very rapid development of precisely those types of radio antennas and receivers that the radio astronomers were to require for theirwork.

However, the picture appeared very confusing. Nearby galaxies, such as M31 in Andromeda, were at best faint radio sources while very distant galaxies, such as Virgo A (M87) and Cygnus A, were powerful emitters of radio signals. Centaurus A was associated with the galaxy NGC5128 and was clearly not at all well behaved because it showed a dark dust lane crossing in front of an elliptical galaxy not expected to contain dust. At the time, no accepted theory existed to explain their radio emissions.

In the 1930s and 1940s no one knew that interstellar space contained cosmic ray electrons or that there were magnetic fields between the stars. At the time, cosmic rays were defined as protons (but not electrons) from space that struck the earth continuously.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Cosmic ray physicists didn’t concern themselves too much about the origin of the cosmic rays, nor did they know what happened to the electrons. Those researchers were mainly interested in studying the composition and physical properties of the particles that did reach their detectors. The absence of electrons was noted, but who would have thought that the electrons didn’t reach the earth because they had wasted their energy radiating radio signals in interstellar space.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAfter the World War II, Enrico Fermi proposed that cosmic ray electrons could be accelerated in interstellar space, provided magnetic fields were present, but it wasn’t until 1951 that evidence for such fields was obtained through the observation of the polarization of starlight by dust grains aligned by those fields. Later, when supernova remnants (the remains of exploded stars) were recognized to be strong sources of radio waves and when their polarization was measured, astronomers did realize that cosmic rays originated in supernovae. (Polarization refers to a preferred plane of vibration of the incoming radio waves, for example, horizontal or vertical or at some angle in between.) The cosmic ray electrons, spiraling about magnetic fields, cause the supernova remnants to shine. The electrons then leak out into space and ultimately cause the entire Milky Way to glow with radio energy.

The first generation of large radio dishes, the 250-ft diameter Jodrell Mark I (1957), and the NRAO 300-ft (1962) were years from completion. Receiver technology was still relatively crude and internally generated receiver noise hampered efforts to detect faint radio signals from space. (Receiver noise is generated because elements of the radio receiver are themselves at some finite, and in those days, quite high temperature.) \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBy the late 1950s the science appeared to be in a state of relative confusion.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e David O.

But Turing’s work during the Second World War was so crucial that Winston Churchill acknowledged his role, saying that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory. Who was Turing and what did he do that was so important?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eMathematician\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAlan Turing was a brilliant mathematician. Born in London in 1912, he studied at both Cambridge and Princeton universities. He was already working part-time for the British Government’s Code and Cypher School before the Second World War broke out. In 1939, Turing took up a full-time role at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire -- where top secret work was carried out to decipher the military codes used by Germany and its allies.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eEnigma and the Bombe\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe main focus of Turing’s work at Bletchley was in cracking the ‘Enigma’ code. The Enigma was a type of enciphering machine used by the German armed forces to send messages securely. Although Polish mathematicians had worked out how to read Enigma messages and had shared this information with the British, the Germans increased its security at the outbreak of war by changing the cipher system daily. This made the task of understanding the code even more difficult.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTuring played a key role in this, inventing -- along with fellow code-breaker Gordon Welchman -- a machine known as the Bombe. This device helped to significantly reduce the work of the code-breakers. From mid-1940, German Air Force signals were being read at Bletchley and the intelligence gained from them was helping the war effort.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eScience&#39;s Information Machine\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt takes some reading to achieve, but for those who take the time to listen to the critics and &quot;heretics&quot; of modern science, they will eventually experience the formation of a tacit sense for how science, in practice, progresses -- or more usefully, how it \u003cb\u003eresists\u003c/b\u003e progression.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis is not to pretend that studies of the sociology of science do not already exist.  They do.  The problem is that they build upon a philosophical tradition of analyzing \u003cb\u003eformer\u003c/b\u003e rather than \u003cb\u003eactive\u003c/b\u003e controversies -- and in the spirit of specialization, the science studies critiques have failed to specifically connect the dots from failures in theory back to failures in process.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eCareful, sustained inspection of ongoing scientific controversies reveals that the &quot;anti-patterns&quot; of scientific research can oftentimes be traced back to some aspect of the process for publishing or selecting scientific information -- its rewards, discussion and/or vetting.

Some of science&#39;s information systems do utilize the Internet, but these systems were never designed as a reaction to critiques.  They are essentially simplistic attempts to mine the crowd for information which root in a tradition of ignoring challenges to textbook theory.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThus, we have good reason to suspect an impending profound change in science&#39;s relationship to information.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNow, there has been some debate within the academic community over whether or not the recent movie, \u003ci\u003eThe Imitation Game\u003c/i\u003e, accurately conveys Turing&#39;s role in the invention of the computer.  That debate is worth checking out, but it could be a technical distraction from a more fundamental lesson about the use of a computer to crack Enigma.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe lesson is simply stated as:\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhen a problem seems insurmountable, the proper approach is to &quot;go to process&quot;.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt&#39;s a crucial lesson because it will eventually also prove to apply to the larger enterprise of science itself.  And what will prove quite humbling for the scientific community in due time -- once we have the benefit of hindsight -- is that it will take an outsider to fix it.  The ceaseless threat of publish-or-perish essentially ensures that academics will remain heads-down, refusing to stop what they&#39;re doing long enough to fix any fundamental process issues which publicly surface.  Rather telling is that when I do rarely succeed in evoking a response from actual academics to critiques of their process \u003cb\u003eby other scientists and academic whistleblowers\u003c/b\u003e, they tend to ironically respond that \u003cb\u003eI\u003c/b\u003e do not understand &quot;how science works&quot;.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eProbably many people who have followed the Controversies of Science collection are not fully tuned into the implications of what we can do with this understanding that is being created. There is an opportunity here to construct a parallel world of scientific discourse which is fundamentally \u003cb\u003edesigned\u003c/b\u003e to be reactive to all of the critiques of modern science.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eNobody&#39;s ever done this before.  In fact, it&#39;s only become possible in very recent times -- since the rise of the Internet.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ePart of the point of the wisdom-of-crowds posts to this collection was to demonstrate the importance of \u003cb\u003edesigning\u003c/b\u003e our communication infrastructure to service science&#39;s need to remain innovative.  The intent was to show how easy it is for an innovative system to slip into bureacratic groupthink habits.  Innovation should never be a circumstantial aspect of an information system -- yet that is exactly what has happened with today&#39;s academic community: Genius is assumed to be rare and uncrackable by any specific methodology.  Where it happens by chance to emerge, we perhaps have a dim chance of understanding it by slicing up and analyzing the genius&#39; brains (it&#39;s surreal).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe mainstream approach to wisdom and genius is absurd in the way it takes for granted the mechanics of the current academic system, bestowing peer review as the best system we can conceive, and then labeling the rare innovator as a remarkable achievement of that very system.  \u003cb\u003eIt seems to never dawn upon many people today that the rarity of innovation within the sciences is in fact the product of this very system.\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe infrastructures we currently use to publish, discuss and vet our ideas in the sciences today were not actually \u003cb\u003edesigned\u003c/b\u003e to innovate at the globally connected scale, since they exhibit no visibility into innovation&#39;s long tail.  Peer review is a rejection of wisdom from the crowd because it&#39;s fundamentally a filter for expertise.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWe do of course have a crucial need for both filters and experts, but the lesson of the Enigma is that when problems seem insurmountable, we must scrutinize our process for inefficiencies.  Now combine that with the lesson of scientific controversies -- that what sometimes separates culture from some new innovation is the experts themselves.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt should be apparent that although we of course rely heavily upon expertise every day, it&#39;s a mistake to \u003cb\u003eonly\u003c/b\u003e rely upon experts when it comes to claims which have become contested.  We should re-design science&#39;s information systems to also extract wisdom from the crowd -- never straying so far from the pre-existing body of critiques and controversies of science that we lose touch with the reasons for why we are doing it.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23information\"\u003e#information\u003c/a\u003e             \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23epistemology\"\u003e#epistemology\u003c/a\u003e             \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23controversy\"\u003e#controversy\u003c/a\u003e       \ufeff",

A new study shows how recent advances in molecular epigenetics and re-examination of his descriptions suggest the experiments were actually authentic.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe alleged scientific fraud by Paul Kammerer is perhaps one of the most controversial mysteries in the history of biology. In the early 20th century, he was a famous evolutionary scientist, hailed as a &#39;new Darwin&#39; in the pages of the New York Times. His experiments provided impressive evidence that environmental life experiences could have a direct, inheritable effect on progeny, as maintained by his intellectual predecessor Lamarck, and by Darwin himself.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e In one of his most famous experiments, Kammerer had shown how a normally terrestrial species, the midwife toad, could be made to live and mate in water when kept in an artificially heated environment. These modified &#39;water&#39; toads laid eggs that grew into toads with an innate preference to live and mate in water, even when raised in normal, unheated environments. In successive generations of water toads, Kammerer reported that male toads developed nuptial pads on their fingers. These are rough, dark-colored thickenings of skin that are usually absent in midwife toads, but present in other water-loving species, which use them to grasp females during copulation. Additionally, Kammerer crossed one of his modified &#39;water&#39; males with a normal, untreated land female, obtaining 100% water toads in the first generation, and about three-quarters water toads in the second generation. Thus, modified traits were being inherited according to Mendel&#39;s rules of genetics, the same that most of us were taught in high school.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn 1926, fellow scientist G.K. Noble examined a fixed and worn-out specimen of an experimental &#39;water&#39; toad. Noble found that the fingers had been injected with india ink to create an artificial resemblance to nuptial pads. A huge scandal ensued, placing Kammerer&#39;s entire scientific legacy into question. Kammerer committed suicide shortly after, and although he left letters maintaining that his results were authentic, many interpreted the suicide as an admission of guilt. Thus, Paul Kammerer became a symbol of scientific fraud, as well as a powerful story about the ultimate failure and scientific invalidity of studies in the &#39;inheritance of acquired traits.&#39; This view of Kammerer has continued to be the mainstream opinion\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, although some voices have defended his innocence. Soviet contemporaries did not accept the fraud accusations, and even made a popular propaganda film, &#39;Salamandra&#39; (1928), that narrated how Kammerer (who was a leftist jew) had been framed by his enemies in the wake of Austrian Nazism. In the 1970&#39;s, the renowned journalist Arthur Koestler wrote a famous book, &#39;The case of the midwife toad,&#39; which pointed out several problems with the fraud accusations, including the fact that the specimens had been observed by several experts, who should not have been easily fooled by crude ink injections.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt is no secret that even today, the &#39;inheritance of acquired characteristics&#39; is often treated as an impossibility, supposedly discarded by experiments such as the amputation of the tail of mice during successive generations, which never leads to mice being born without tails. It was argued that no special mechanism existed by which environmental change could directly modify inheritance, and that every apparent case could be ultimately explained by indirect effects of natural selection and conventional genetics. But these views started to change drastically since the 1990&#39;s, along with the progress in techniques to study molecular genetics. These uncovered several molecular mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, that could directly change inheritance in response to the environment. The modern field of epigenetics studies those changes in gene expression that do not involve a mutation, but are nevertheless inherited in absence of the signal or event that initiated the change. During the 21st century, experiments in mice have reported such inheritable modifications, identifying the relevant genes that have been altered by epigenetic mechanisms.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn light of these recent ground-breaking discoveries, a team of scientists from the University of Chile (Alexander Vargas), the Technical University of Munich (Quirin Krabichler) , and Linköping University (Carlos Guerrero-Bosagna) have re-examined Kammerer&#39;s descriptions of the midwife toad experiments, and have published their conclusions yesterday in the Journal of Experimental Zoology. The situation is perhaps analogous to detectives analysing a journal that describes numerous murders in great detail: There are many opportunities to find out whether it fits with reality, or is merely a work of fantasy. If some of the alleged data in Kammerer&#39;s papers were entirely extraordinary, beyond known phenomena or explanatory mechanisms, we should remain cautious. If, in turn, science offers experimental evidence that matches Kammerer&#39;s reports down to specific details, we may consider a greater likelihood of their authenticity.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe team concluded that Kammerer&#39;s descriptions are completely within the realm of possibilities uncovered by modern epigenetics. This in itself is an important alternative to fraud and the alleged impossibility of the experiments. However, they additionally confirmed a very special detail about the experiments: Dominance in hybrid crosses would depend on the sex of the toads, such that if Kammerer now crossed a land male with a water female, the first generation would be 100% land toads, and the next, ¾ land toads. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSuch switches in dominance according to sex (also known as &#39;parent of origin effects&#39;) have been known to scientists for a long time, but have only recently been understood to result from epigenetic mechanisms. Kammerer and other Lamarckians never placed any importance on this detail, which was mentioned as little more than a curiosity. However, since epigenetic mechanisms produce these effects in several modern experiments, it provides a very specific resemblance, that strongly suggests the authenticity of the midwife toad experiments. There is no good reason why Kammerer would invent such a detail if his descriptions were a mere work of fantasy.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe new in-depth study of Kammerer&#39;s descriptions has also clarified several important details about the experiments, which are shown to favor an epigenetic mechanism over other discussed alternatives. Recent claims that Kammerer would provide changing and unreliable accounts of his experiments are also conclusively discarded by the new study. Gunter Wagner, an evolutionary geneticist and professor at Yale University, calls the new study an &#39;exciting read&#39; and \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;the most in depth analysis of Paul Kammerer&#39;s primary publications to date, and the only one that has been performed in the light of recent biological knowledge on epigenetics.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhy did so many of Kammerer&#39;s contemporaries disbelieve the experiments? Most likely, they were conceptually unprepared to understand the results, many of which are puzzling and hard to make sense of without a modern knowledge of epigenetic molecular mechanisms. An especially important contemporary of Kammerer was William Bateson, who coined the word &#39;genetics.&#39; Bateson described the results of Kammerer&#39;s hybrid crosses as &#39;most astounding,&#39; but doubted their reality, arguing that until they were clearly demonstrated and confirmed, &#39;we are absolved from basing broad conclusions on his testimony.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIndeed, Kammerer had a unique way of thinking for his time. While most of his contemporaries would split into opposite &#39;Mendelian&#39; and &#39;Lamarckian&#39; bands, he combined the experimental principles of both schools of thought. He was also unusual among Lamarckians in that he did not believe that the inheritance of acquired traits was necessarily progressive or beneficial, but could also produce neutral or detrimental traits.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe new paper by Vargas, Krabichler and Guerrero-Bosagna coincides with the very recent publication of a new book in German, &#39;Der Fall Paul Kammerer&#39; (&#39;The case of Paul Kammerer&#39;) by journalist Klaus Taschwer. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis book provides abundant new historical data on the strange circumstances surrounding the discovery of the ink-injected nuptial pads, strongly suggesting that Kammerer was indeed framed. Combined with the scientific approach of Vargas et al., there is now more evidence than ever that suggests the authenticity of the midwife toad experiments.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Conclusive evidence, however, can only come from renewed experimentation with the midwife toad. New molecular techniques would allow a quick assessment of epigenetic mechanisms, and important advances have already been made that demonstrate epigenetic inheritance and parent of origin effects in other amphibians. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eTo further encourage new research in the midwife toad, Vargas et al have included a model of epigenetic mechanisms that can explain Kammerer&#39;s results through specific assumptions, that can be experimentally tested.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Renewed research in the midwife toad may not only give closure to one of the most intriguing mysteries in the history of biology, but it is also likely to generate important scientific advances on how epigenetic mechanisms work in evolution and adaptation.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eModern epigenetics may clear Kammerer&#39;s name, and is already carrying out what is likely to be his unfulfilled contribution to science. In an ironic final paragraph of his paper on hybrid crosses, Kammerer alludes to the fact that Mendel himself was overlooked in his lifetime: &#39;May my work fare better than its great predecessor written by Mendel; may it find its useful application in science and economy before the author&#39;s death and before the passing of many decades!&#39;&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eHere&#39;s a sampling of some critique of Kammerer from 1975, which I will follow with a far more recent update that you will observe contradicts many of the claims made here.

Kingsley Noble, Chairman of the Departments of Herpetology and Experimental Biology, a young colleague whom I had just befriended remarked most profoundly, &#39;Noble, you know, is the man who exposed Kammerer.&#39; Although this notorious scandal had reached its climax 12 years before with the suicide of the then illustrious Professor Paul Kammerer, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eI was familiar with this amazing story, for it was regularly told to biology students as an object lesson. In essence, falsifying evidence is just about the worst sin that a scientist can commit since such actions threaten to destroy the very heart of the scientific system. During the intervening years, Kammerer, his writings, and his theories have fallen into oblivion. In a recent, informal poll of gradtiate students and young instructors including one assistant curator of amphibians and reptiles, I found that none had even heard of the Kammerer affair.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFrom material that I have examined over the years, including Noble&#39;s &#39;Kammerer file,&#39; I gather that many if not most biologists were convinced that Kammerer was guilty, that Noble had performed an important service to science by exposing him, that \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethe famous geneticist William Bateson was clearly justified in regularly expressing, in the pages of the prestigious professional journal Nature, his intense skepticism concerning the validity of Kammerer&#39;s many experiments\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, and that the Lamarckian doctrine concerning the hereditary fixation of structures and processes acquired during an individual&#39;s lifetime lacked valid scientific support. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eArthur Koestler would change all of these views and more. Since he is a superb writer with a fine reputation and since his book, The Case of the Midwife Toad (1971), is modeled after a &#39;whodunnit&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e and reads better than the best of them, there is no question that he has successfully rescued Kammerer from the graveyard of forgotten people. In the course of this resurrection Kammerer becomes the righteous and courageous victim of an &#39;inhuman establishment&#39;; Bateson becomes a totally unscrupulous villain who stooped habitually to falsehood and subterfuge in his unjustified attacks on Kammerer; Noble is a clever &#39;ruffian&#39; who was nevertheless duped into believing that he had caught Kammerer red-handed; Hans Przibram, Director of the Vienna Biologisches Versuchsanstalt, where Kammerer performed his experiments, is pictured as a &#39;benevolent and saintly&#39; man beyond reproach; the inheritance of acquired characteristics is revived as a valid and useful theory in evolutionary biology; \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eand, most important, the scientific community is characterized as basically irresponsible and corrupt.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKoestler writes with great confidence. There is no question that he examined much of the evidence carefully. Most of the statements in his book are documented, and long passages are quoted, especially from letters and articles in Nature. He examined personal correspondence of Bateson and obtained much private information from various sources, especially from Kammerer&#39;s only daughter, Laeerta (named after a genus of lizards), and from Bateson&#39;s only surviving son, Gregory (named after Gregor Mendel). Presented in this authoritative framework, Koestler&#39;s claims and charges should not be taken lightly. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThey come, unfortunately, at a time when the antiscience movement is growing (Newell, 1974) and many young people are searching for arguments to reject the system although they have no realistic alternatives. I am afraid that this book will give them only false support and false hopes.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e But first the story, which Koestler presents succinctly and clearly.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe European midwife toad, known to scientists as Alytes obstetricans, lays its eggs on land. The sticky eggs cling to the male, who carries them around until they hatch. Most other frogs and toads spawn in water and this keeps the eggs from becoming adhesive. Like other tailless amphibians, the male Alytes clasps the female&#39;s body with its forelimbs during copulation and the eggs are fertilized as the female expels them. During the spawning season, the males of many amphibians develop spiny, black areas, called nuptial pads, on the outer surfaces of the forelimbs (Noble, 1931). These assist the male in maintaining his clasp, especially when the female&#39;s skin is wet and slippery. When spawning takes place on land, however, the female&#39;s skin is dry, and, as might be expected, the male Alytes does not develop these pads. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBy keeping the surrounding temperature high, Kammerer induced Alytes to spawn in water. Although these &#39;water eggs&#39; did not adhere to the male, Kammerer succeeded with great difficulty in raising a small number to maturity. He bred these offspring in water also (Kammerer, 1913a). In this way he raised five generations of water-bred Alytes. In the third generation he noticed faint beginnings of nuptial pads, and these became more pronounced with each subsequent generation. Kammerer claimed that the pads had become acquired hereditary characters. Since the terrestrial midwife toad must have evolved from an aquatic form that originally had pads, Kammerer (1919b) later agreed that the occurrence of pads could be explained as a case of atavism, meaning reversion to the ancestral condition. He emphasized that this experiment did not provide substantial evidence for Lamarckian theory. Referring to his Alytes experiments, Kammerer (1923a) wrote &#39;In my opinion it is by no means a conclusive proof of the inheritance of acquired characters.&#39; The real evidence, he said, came from his experiments with the sea squirt Ciona (Kammerer, 1923a, 1924b). Nevertheless, because of its uniqueness, the midwife toad experiment received a great deal of attention and was widely and incorrectly cited as Kammerer&#39;s crucial test of Lamarckian theory. Koestler, however, blames the undue attention given to this noncritical experiment on the evil machinations of William Bateson, who sensed that it would be Kammerer&#39;s undoing.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBetween 1919 and 1926 the Controversy raged, mostly in the pages of Nature. Apparently only a very few scientists ever saw any of the Alytes specimens with nuptial pads, because, according to Kammerer (1919b), they appeared only during the breeding season and he hesitated to preserve his subjects since he needed all his precious few animals for breeding further generations. This scarcity of preserved material became an important item in the controversy, and Koestler accepts Kammerer&#39;s explanation. It seems to me that if Kammerer really wanted to preserve his evidence he could have done so by first using the males for breeding and then preserving them with their pads still present.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhen Kammerer (1923a) gave his famous lectures at Cambridge and London, he brought with him just one preserved water-bred Alytes. This specimen had a large nuptial pad on the left forelimb.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Most of the right pad had been removed previously (Bateson, 1923a; Kammerer, 1923a) for microscopic examination (Koestler mixes this up and says that the left pad had been removed). It is not at all clear whether there ever had been additional preserved evidence, but Koestler implies that there was by noting that Przibram&#39;s Versuchsanstalt had been badly neglected during World War I and preserved material in it may have been destroyed. Also, Dr. Paul Weiss, the renowned embryologist, who was an assistant at the time in the Versuchsanstalt, does recall, in a letter to Koestler, a second specimen with &#39;an equally aberrant &#39;pigment spot.&#39;&#39; In England, the famous specimen was superficially examined by a number of scientists including Bateson. After Kammerer left England, Bateson apparently pondered further about the unusual location of the blackened area on thepalm of the hand, which he described as &#39;a piece of thickened blackish-brown skin&#39; (Bateson, 1923a). He therefore asked Przibram to send the specimen to him for further examination (Bateson, 1923b). Przibram refused, stating that he could not take the responsibility of entrusting the sample to anyone else (Przibram, 1923).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eNear the middle 1920s, G. Kingsley Noble joined the controversy. In photographs of stained microscopic sections published by Kammerer, Noble noticed that certain glands in the pad did not look right. Then in 1926 he visited the institute in Vienna and examined the famous specimen. He soon discovered that there was something very wrong (Fig. 1). He and Przibram (Kammerer had already left the Institute) agreed to study the pad independently and they both concluded that the black coloring was nothing but India ink.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e These conclusions were based on independent gross and histological examination of the pad as well as chemical analyses of the black pigment. At first, Noble and Przibram planned to publish a joint paper in Nature describing their shocking discovery, and I found this manuscript in Noble&#39;s files. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eLater they disagreed because Noble felt that other discrepancies suggested to him that the pad was never geniune while Przibram held that it was originally a genuine pad that had been doctored with ink at a later date. They therefore published their findings independently (Noble, 1926; Przibram, 1926a). A month later, Kammerer shot himself. In a farewell letter to Przibram (1926b), he alleged that an unknown person must have injected the ink.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt is a bit ironic that 3 years before, in 1923, Kammerer had written a long letter to Dr. Henry Fairfield Osborn, President of The American Museum, pleading for a job. In a brief reply, Osborn urged Kammerer to meet with G. K. Noble and discuss the job situation with him. Kammerer apparently met with Noble, and I wonder now whether this meeting stirred Noble&#39;s curiosity about Kammerer&#39;s research.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKammerer also wrote a letter to the Moscow Academy of Science a few days before his death. A translation of this letter published in Science (Kammerer, 1926) and reprinted in two books by Conway Zirkle (1949, 1959) reads in part \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;After having read the [Noble&#39;s] attack I went to the Biological Experimental Institute for the purpose of looking over the object in question. I found the statements of Dr. Noble completely verified. Indeed, there were still other objects (blackened salamanders) upon which my results had plainly been &#39;improved&#39; post mortem with India ink. Who, besides myself, had any interest in perpetuating such falsifications can only be very dimly suspected.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Przibram (1926c) also mentions &#39;the existence of other doctored specimens ...&#39; Although Koestler presents a glowing description of the important salamander experiments, he never once mentions that the evidence in these studies had also been tampered with. Could it be that Koestler was not aware of the letter in Science and had seen only Wettstein&#39;s (1926) brief quotation from it in the Neue Freie Presse?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKoestler has gone to great lengths to convince his readers that a genuine pad was present when the specimen was demonstrated in England in 1923. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHe even enlisted the support of the well-known biochemist Holger Hyden, who ran some tests on Alytes showing that the India ink would not remain black when the subjects were preserved for more than a few weeks in a variety of preservatives. This seems to me to have been a useless exercise, for even without the mentality of Sherlock Holmes I can easily imagine the ink being injected on more than one occasion. Koestler asks why the eminent scientists of England who examined the specimen failed to recognize the deception, while a few years later Noble discovered fraud almost immediately.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e But did they?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDereck Freeman (1972) in a letter to the New Scientist has called attention to a book by Dr. H. Graham Cannon (1959) in which he describes a meeting in England of Kammerer, McBride, Bateson, and himself during April 1923. Bateson, Cannon says, examined the specimen with a hand lens and remarked, &#39;It looks to me like a spot of ink.&#39; Perhaps this observation, rather than Bateson&#39;s evil inclinations, explains his desire to have the specimen returned to England for further study. Koestler omits all references to this episode in his book, but in reply to Freeman he implies that Cannon was in his dotage and did not remember correctly events occurring 36 years earlier. Koestler (1972a) cites other errors in Cannon&#39;s book to bolster his claim. Considering, however, Bateson&#39;s (1923a) open and continued skepticism concerning the pad, the remark that Cannon recalls seems entirely plausible. Eight months after Kammerer&#39;s death, Przibram (1926e) reviewed in Nature all the evidence, especially photographs of the pad and Kammerer&#39;s changing descriptions of them. Przibram came to the conclusion that the pad must have been altered between 1919 and 1922 (before the Cambridge and London lectures, contrary to Koestler&#39;s main argument), and also that Kammerer was aware that the pad looked different in 1923. Koestler dismisses these arguments in like manner, attributing them to Przibram&#39;s &#39;disturbed state of mind&#39; which was &#39;hopelessly muddled.&#39; Koestler&#39;s selective bias is also reflected in his treatment of Alma Mahler-Werfel&#39;s biography (1958). He includes the episode in which Kammerer fell madly in love with her and threatened to shoot himself on Gustav Mahler&#39;s grave unless she married him. On the other hand, he omits her account of her experiences as Kammerer&#39;s assistant: &#39;I kept very exact records. That too annoyed Kammerer. Slightly less exact records with positive results would have pleased him more.&#39; I see this statement as an important clue suggesting that Kammerer may have encouraged his assistants, perhaps unintentionally, to provide the kind of data that he wanted. But Koestler, I am sure, would dismiss Alma&#39;s remark, as can be seen by referring to the following passage from his book: &#39;she got all her facts wrong and wrote with undisguised venom.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKoestler considers a number of hypotheses for the suicide. Kammerer was scheduled to leave shortly for Moscow, where he had accepted a Chair in Genetics and was scheduled to build an institute for experimental biology. His theoretical position on the inheritance of acquired characteristics seemed to fit in very well with Marxist philosophy, and the Russians were not at all disturbed by the accusation of fraud -- it was just a capitalist plot. Perhaps, says Koestler, Kammerer just could not leave Vienna, or live permanently in Russia; perhaps his latest conquest, Grete Wiesenthal, would not leave with him for Moscow; perhaps he mourned the loss of his collections at the institute; perhaps a technician had deceived him for one of several reasons. Koestler, however, settles on a political explanation: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eKammerer was a socialist and atheist who talked favorably of the USSR. The Nazi movement was gaining strength and an unidentified enemy who knew of Noble&#39;s pending visit injected the ink so that Kammerer would be caught.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKoestler is convinced that Kammerer himself did not commit the fraud, but this was not the opinion of a number of biologists at the time. A letter found in Noble&#39;s file from the renowned geneticist of Columbia University, Thomas Hunt Morgan, dated October 11, 1926, reads in part &#39;Kammerer has done one more dirty trick in trying to put the fraud over on to his assistants. Remember that this is not the first time, either, that he has been caught, and all responsible people I think will draw the same conclusion.&#39; It is not possible for me to say what other &#39;dirty tricks&#39; Morgan had in mind. Perhaps he was thinking of the sensational news stories that Kammerer engendered during his American lecture tour. Morgan maintained that Kammerer was at least partly responsible for this sensationalism (see Koestler, 1971, p. 92). From a revealing handwritten note to Noble, dated November 15, 1926, from the Viennese biologist Professor Franz Werner, we read in broken English, &#39;You have no doubt done a good work to have unveiled the true nature of Kammerer at least to science. We have never had confidence to him at all, and myself, who has known him still as a boy, knows best, how many lies he has put in the world during his life. But he was a very able and intelligent man and it is a pity that he has not made a better use of the rich gifts of nature, induced, as he always was by the desire of being spoken of, of being the object of enthusiastic admiration of half-grown girls and boys and of the people of his own race, the newspapers of which have much contributed to his rising. Now he is the third of the Biolog. Versuchsanstalt convicted of foul things -- Koppanyi and Finken having been already done.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe innocence or guilt of Kammerer is far from settled\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, and Przibram, despite his &#39;saintliness,&#39; may have been grossly negligent concerning the affairs of his institute. It seems best, therefore, to follow my opening proverb and &#39;say nothing but good of the dead.&#39; But this dictum should apply equally to Bateson, whose actions can just as easily be interpreted as the search for truth as diabolical machinations. On the other hand, calling Noble a &#39;ruffian&#39; on the hearsay evidence of Gregory Bateson is patently false and libelous, although it is true that while Noble endeared himself to some colleagues he antagonized others. Gregory, on the other hand, is obviously so bitter that he even maligned his father: &#39;He was certainly not a nice man whenever the inheritance of acquired characteristics was mentioned.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eKoestler spends much time extolling the virtues of Lamarckian theory and emphasizes the impossibility that chance mutations could have produced the wonderful adaptations that are so commonplace in the world of nature. While these arguments may impress laymen, to the biologist they reveal Koestler&#39;s total lack of understanding of modern concepts of evolution. That recent advances in genetics and molecular biology seem to mesh so well with Mendelian concepts does not impress Koestler, whereas the fact that no biochemical mechanism (indeed, no system of any kind) has been forthcoming to explain how acquired characteristics change the genetic constitution does not bother Koestler one bit.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKoestler&#39;s attack on science and scientists occurs on two fronts. First, he says that frauds are commonplace in science but few scientists are troubled by them. He cites Ronald Fisher&#39;s (1936) accusation that Mendel&#39;s original data must have been doctored that the ratios of his peas are too close to expectancy. But Koestler neglects to say that Sewall Wright (1966) and others have explained the close conformity as the result of unintentional biases which usually occur in measurements. In Mendel&#39;s time, the need for &#39;double-blind&#39; experiments had not yet been realized and no techniques existed for performing them. Kammerer&#39;s (1924a,b) most extensive research dealt with reproductive and color differences in species of European salamanders. In his long critique of Kammerer&#39;s experiments, Cunningham (1928) noted that when Kammerer crossed two naturally occurring forms of Salamandra maculosa he reported an exact 3:1 ratio in the F2 (231 forma typica to 77 forma taeniata) (Kammerer, 1913b). These striking data, which may also have been influenced by unintentional experimental biases, apparently escaped Koestler&#39;s attention.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eEqually serious is Koestler&#39;s repeated charge that the scientific community has been irresponsible in not repeating Kammerer&#39;s main experiments.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e In the first place, several unsuccessful attempts to do so have been made by various people. Munro Fox tried unsuccessfully to repeat the &#39;crucial&#39; sea squirt study on the inheritance of acquired characters, but Koestler treats this controversy very badly. He attempts to protect Kammerer in a most devious manner and fails to cite Fox&#39;s (1924) definitive report. While Koestler cites the Ciona experiment as Kammerefs strongest evidence favoring the inheritance of acquired characters, he does not explain how amputating sea squirt syphons for several generations differs in essence from amputating mice tails, which he ridicules in an earlier chapter. Kammerer (1924b), on the other hand, was aware of this difficulty and attempted to circumvent it by explaining that the sea squirt responds to mutilation by adaptively regenerating a new syphon, while mice do not regenerate tails. However, he does not explain how regenerating a longer than normal syphon is more of an adaptation to mutilation than not growing a new tail.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKammerer always said that failure to repeat his studies resulted from not following his descriptions completely. But a 100% replication of any experiment is never really possible in the life sciences, so that a negative finding cannot be conclusive. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut over and above any need to confirm or disprove, no scientist should feel obligated to investigate a theory that does not meet his interests or give promise of forming the substrate for future investigation.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Theories are not proven or disproven, or voted in or out. They merely gain or lose adherents. This is the way of science. Koestler does not appreciate this and the sterility of Lamarckianism. Finally, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eshould scientists feel obligated to repeat Kammerer&#39;s experiments aside from their theoretical interpretations? The answer is no. Obviously all phenomena or all possible leads cannot be investigated. The scientist chooses those avenues that promise to bring the greatest advances, those experiments that he believes are most likely to open new vistas.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Kammerer&#39;s experiments were ingenious, and someone may find a renewed interest in them, but not for the reasons that Koestler gives.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKammerer espoused a more sensational and scientifically dubious cause and wrote a book translated into English on the subject -- Rejuvenation and the Prolongation of Human Efficiency (1923b). This book is a popular exposition of the then famous but now discredited &#39;Steinach operation.&#39; He explains very clearly how simple vasoligation (now popularly known as vasectomy) causes marked physical rejuvenation of middle-aged men. For women, X-irradiation of the ovaries does the same, but he notes that the techniques are still being developed.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKammerer (1919a) was also interested in collecting and analyzing coincidences and published a book on the subject. This phenomenon is akin to parapsychology except that Kammerer deals with naturally occurring situations, whereas in extrasensory perception the experimenter usually arranges the situation. Advocates of ESP talk about unknown psychic processes, whereas Kammerer talks about &#39;a principle in nature which operates independently from the known physical laws of causation.&#39; Koestler seems to be enamoured of this work, and he has made it the subject of another book (Koestler, 1972b) that gives an aura of scientific respectability to spiritualism, clairvoyance, telepathy, psychokinesis, and other invocations of the supernatural. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the long run, Koestler seems to prefer mystical to rational explanations, thus providing comfort and support to those who wish to avoid valid cause and, with it, legitimate responsibility.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eConsidering the dearth of good writers who can effectively explain science to the public, it is a pity that Koestler is squandering his precious writing talents in ways that will only add confusion to the minds of his lay reader.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eACKNOWLEDGMENTS\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eI wish to thank Dr. James W.

One of the first problems that will be encountered by those interested in epigenetics is that the word can currently be used with different meanings, creating some controversy about its proper application. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe word &#39;epigenetics&#39; was originally coined by Conrad Waddington to combine &#39;epi&#39; (&#39;above&#39; or &#39;on top&#39;) with the word &#39;genetics,&#39; while also resembling Aristotle’s developmental concept of &#39;epigenesis.&#39; Waddington used the term for the study of complex interactions among genes and environment in producing the phenotype (Waddington, ’42). Some authors follow this originally broad meaning to refer to any nongenetic factors (environmental or physical) capable of producing developmental variation, regardless of whether they have a stable, inheritable effect. In more recent times, however, the term epigenetics has been increasingly used with a more specific meaning, for the study of changes in gene expression that do not involve a mutation but are, nevertheless, inherited after cell divisions, in the absence of the signal or event that initiated the change (Pearson, 2008; Skinner, 2011). This means changes are stable throughout mitosis, and in multicellular organisms, they may even be inherited through the germ line.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e In this article, we will adopt the modern sense of the word and use the term &#39;preepigenetic&#39; to refer to those analyses and accounts that have not considered the recent molecular advances of epigenetics.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eModern epigenetics is arguably a branch of molecular genetics. However, it uses basic experimental principles that were also popular among the &#39;neo-Lamarckians&#39; of the early 20th century. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOrganisms are exposed to an environmental stimulus that leads to an altered phenotype. Then, it is observed whether their progeny will develop the same altered phenotype, without exposure to the same environmental stimulus. If so, the environmental exposure may have induced a heritable modification in the germ line of their parents. The altered phenotype may then continue in further unexposed generations. The more generations it persists, the more stable is the germ line modification. An impressive example of such transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) is provided by recent experiments on parental olfactory experience (Dias and Ressler, 2014). After being exposed to an odorant, F0 mice were subjected to a stressful sound, learning to dread this odor. They suffered structural modifications of olfactory neurons that express the odorant’s receptor and stressful reactions to the odorant before the onset of the sound. Impressively, the same structural modification of these neurons and the same behavioral response to the odor were found in the subsequent F1 and F2 generations, which were never subjected to such training. Needless to say, the entire experiment smacks of Lamarckism. Perhaps the only reason why the reality of these experiments is no longer questioned is that we are now able to study specific molecular changes that occur in the germ line in response to the environment. For instance, in that experiment, hypomethylation of the odorant receptor gene occurs in the F0 and F1 male germ lines, confirming the role of epigenetic alterations in the inheritance of this induced trait.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSeveral molecular mechanisms are known to be involved in TEI, including various types of noncoding RNAs, histone modifications, DNA methylation and hydroxy-methylation, and combinations of these mechanisms. Methylation and demethylation of DNA at CpG sites is one of the better-understood mechanisms in modern epigenetics. Early advances on this topic were achieved through the study of genomic imprinting (Reik et al., ’87), a phenomenon underlying congenital diseases such as Prader–Willi and Angelman syndromes. Deleted regions in chromosome 15 can cause these syndromes, but affected people were found with intact sequences (Nicholls et al., ’89). DNA methylation in these sequences was uncovered as a mechanism capable of silencing gene expression. Methylation of a sequence can downregulate its transcription, and a methylated version of a gene can become functionally equivalent to an inactive, recessive allele (Nicholls and Knepper, 2001). The relevant sequences for Prader–Willi syndrome are inactivated through methylation, which normally occurs only in the maternal germ line. The allele inherited from the father will provide for normal development. However, sometimes a zygote will end up with both copies of chromosome 15 inherited from the mother (uniparental disomy): with both copies inactive, this leads to abnormal development and Prader–Willi syndrome. Similarly, inheriting two copies of chromosome 15 from the father results in Angelman syndrome. In this case, another region of chromosome 15 is methylated only in the germ line of the father.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eGenomic imprinting or the selective inactivation of a gene in the germ line of only one parent (mother or father) is found in several epigenetic mechanisms (Surani, 2001). In a hybrid cross, it produces a phenomenon known as &#39;parent-of-origin effects&#39;: whichever the phenotype of the unsilenced parent will be dominant in the offspring. Parent-of-origin effects have been known from the very beginnings of genetics, and even prior, to livestock breeders. The cross of a donkey with a mare will produce a mule, whereas the cross of a jenny (female donkey) with a horse will produce a hinny -- a radically different phenotype. We now understand how these striking differences between mules and hinnies depend on the sex of the parent. Genes of different species are being differentially silenced in their paternally or maternally inherited alleles.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDNA methylation is not only involved in genomic imprinting, but also in general developmental processes of gene regulation and cell differentiation. While all cells possess essentially the same genome as the totipotential zygote, they differentiate into specialized types (neurons, muscle, etc.) with different genes being selectively silenced. One of these silencing mechanisms is DNA methylation. Gametes are specialized cells and therefore, in order to allow for a totipotential zygote, upon fertilization most of their specific DNA methylation marks are erased or &#39;formatted.&#39; Imprinted genes are an exception (Surani, 2001). DNA methylation survives this formatting process, thus directly affecting the somatic phenotype. Imprinted genes eventually do become erased in primordial germ cells (recruited from somatic cells in the early embryo), which allows them to become remethylated in gametes according to a male or female pattern (Jirtle and Skinner, 2007). Genomic imprinting is an important component of normal development, as exemplified by its disruption in Prader–Willi and Angelman syndromes.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eImportantly, modern epigenetics has shown that environmental changes can alter DNA methylation in the germ line in a way that is stable enough to survive both reformatting episodes (zygote and primordial germ cells), thus being perpetuated for several generations (Guerrero-Bosagna and Skinner, 2012). Initial experimental reports of TEI were made in rodents as a consequence of gestational exposure to endocrine disruptors such as diethylstilbestrol (DES) and vinclozolin. DES is an estrogenic compound prescribed to women from the 1930s to 1970s to prevent miscarriages and other reproductive complications. Later observations showed that DES administration was associated with reproductive defects in the offspring of these treated women (Giusti et al., ’95). Experiments revealed that administration of DES to pregnant rats during early postimplantation development generated reproductive abnormalities of male offspring in the F1 and F2 generations (Newbold et al., 2000). These results led to the suggestion that epigenetic alterations could be involved in the emergence of these reproductive abnormalities and their transmission to future generations. Nonetheless, epigenetic changes in the germ line were only confirmed after experiments involving a gestational exposure to vinclozolin (Anway et al., 2005). Vinclozolin is a fungicide with antiandrogenic effects broadly employed in crops around the world (Wong et al., ’95). Initially, increased apoptosis in spermatogenic cells was observed in the direct (F1) offspring of pregnant rats treated with intraperitoneal injections of the compound (Uzumcu et al., 2004). Follow-up experiments revealed that this increased apoptosis in spermatogenic cells persisted for the next three generations in the absence of any further exposure (Anway et al., 2005; Anway et al., 2006a, 2006b). Changes in DNA methylation of the germ line were also detected three generations after initial maternal exposure (Anway et al., 2005; Guerrero-Bosagna et al., 2010; Manikkam et al., 2012a).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eImportantly, these experiments show \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eparent-of-origin effects\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe transmission of the phenotype is sometimes associated with the male germ line, while at other times with the female germ line.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e For example, transgenerational effects induced by vinclozolin were shown to be transmitted through the male germ line only (Anway et al., 2005; Anway et al., 2006b), while transgenerational effects related to a developmental exposure to the pesticide methoxychlor were primarily transmitted through the female germ line (Manikkam et al., 2014). Interestingly, germ line transgenerational vinclozolin effects have also been described in imprinted genes (Stouder and Paoloni-Giacobino, 2010), and TEI combined with parent-of-origin effects has also been reported in plants (Haun and Springer, 2008). In addition to vinclozolin and methoxychlor, transgenerational germ line epimutations have been reported to derive from exposures to plasticizers (a mixture of bisphenol A and phthalates), pesticides (a mixture of permethrin and DEET), dioxin (the main component of agent orange), jet fuel 8 (Manikkam et al., 2012b), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (Skinner et al., 2013), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE, the degradation product of DDT, Song et al., 2014). Furthermore, induced transgenerational phenotypes continue to appear in a third generation (grandchildren of exposed parents) or further. In all cases, DNA methylation and its stabilization may occur in the male or female germ line, depending on the environmental signal acting as a stimulus, and the timing of exposure during the development. The numerous case studies of TEI stem from a very diverse sample of distantly related organisms, which suggests the ubiquity and prevalence of these mechanisms (Jablonka and Raz, 2009). \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eQuite independently of the specific case of Paul Kammerer, this set of scientific advances calls for a reexamination of the experimental work of the &#39;neo-Lamarckians&#39; in the early 20th century. In itself, it suggests that the lack of evidence was not a main reason for their historical &#39;defeat&#39; in academia.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePreepigenetic Accounts On The Midwife Toad Experiments\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eHaving reviewed the advances of epigenetics, many of which are very recent, we now have the necessary perspective to discuss the midwife toad experiments of Paul Kammerer, and can appreciate the difference with their preepigenetic discussion.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe essential facts on the biology and natural history of normal midwife toads are well known (Stebbins and Cohen, ’95), setting an undisputed background for discussing Kammerer’s claims. The midwife toad is highly terrestrial for an amphibian, even copulating and fertilizing its eggs on land. Unlike the more aquatic lifestyle of its ancestors (San Mauro et al., 2004), the midwife toad does not lay strings of fertilized eggs in the water. Rather, after copulation, the male wraps the eggs around his legs and carries them on land, which means they are exposed to air during their embryonic development. Finally, during a visit of the male into water, the tadpoles hatch and continue with conventional amphibian development, although the larvae emerge at a more advanced stage than related water-loving species.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKammerer, who was a very talented herpetologist, kept and bred midwife toads in terrariums and found that he could, by manipulating the terrarium conditions, induce somatic and behavioral changes some of which were inheritable. The original papers by Kammerer describing the midwife toad experiments are found in several articles written in old-fashioned German (Kammerer, ’06, ’09, ’10, ’11, ’13, ’19). For the larger English-speaking readership, only partial descriptions of Kammerer’s experiments have been available, mostly through second-hand accounts. Inevitably, authors have tended to discuss only those aspects that they considered relevant, according to the knowledge and conceptual tools of their time.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eUntil recently, Koestler’s (’71) book provided the most widely known account of Kammerer’s experiments. Koestler described how midwife toads were kept in an artificially overheated room, where they had the choice to remain on land, or visit a basin of water. Under these conditions, the toads lost their terrestrial preference and spent most of their time in the water, even copulating and fertilizing their eggs in it. Eggs were laid directly in the water and were no longer carried by the male. Only a few (3–5%) of these ‘water’ eggs survived. These eggs developed into adult &#39;water-breeding&#39; toads that preferred copulating in water and no longer took care of the eggs, even under normal, nonheated conditions. Kammerer continued to breed these &#39;water-breeding&#39; toads up to F6 generation. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBy F3 generation, Kammerer noticed that &#39;water&#39; males were developing nuptial pads during the mating season (upon reexamination, Kammerer found that rudimentary nuptial pads were already present at F2 generation).\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eKoestler (’71, p. 43) passingly mentions in his book that Kammerer &#39;also made intricate cross-breeding and ovarytransplant experiments, attempting to show that the hereditary changes followed Mendel’s Laws, and to achieve a reconciliation of Lamarckism with Mendelism&#39;. Another account specifically pointed out that &#39;Kammerer back-crossed his midwife toads and salamanders to unmodified individuals and produced hybrids more or less in Mendelian ratios. By Kammerer’s reasoning, this indicated that the acquisition of characteristics caused Mendelian genes to form on the chromosomes&#39; (Gliboff, 2006). These hybrid crosses strike immediately as being crucial to assess the plausibility of Kammerer’s experiments. However, the crucial paper with Mendelian crosses of midwife toads (Kammerer ’11) had appeared in the same rare journal that Gregor Mendel had chosen for his discoveries, Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Brünn, which ceased to be published in 1919. Thus, no further details about them are found in preepigenetic accounts on Kammerer’s experiments.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eEpigenetics Enters The Kammerer &#39;crime Scene&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIntrigued by the possibility that Kammerer may have stumbled upon epigenetic inheritance, one of us (Vargas, 2009) had analyzed a summary account of the midwife toad experiments that appears in Kammerer’s book, &#39;The Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics.&#39; This book was published in 1924 and was aimed at a broad audience, having been translated to English (Kammerer, ’24). The book contains several aspects of the experiments that were not discussed elsewhere, including a more detailed description of the Mendelian crosses between treated and untreated toads. Here, Kammerer made an interesting observation:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;To be sure, a certain complication arises, inasmuch as the dominant characteristic (i.e.) the one preponderant in all children, and 3/4 of grandchildren, follows the father and, for this reason, a change of dominance from the normal to the changed form is to be observed, depending on whether a normal specimen or a changed specimen plays the part of the father&#39; (Kammerer, ’24, p. 99).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis &#39;complication&#39; (see Figs. 1 and 2) is a clear description of parent-of-origin effects, a detail that bears specific resemblance to currently known experiments like those described above\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e: Many combine TEI with parent-of-origin effects. The book also provided other details left undiscussed by Koestler, such as the fact that the eggs of &#39;water-breeding&#39; toads were of small size. Also, the coat of eggs spawned in water would swell into a thick gelatinous coat, impeding males from carrying the eggs. In normal land-mating conditions, the coat of the eggs becomes sticky upon contact with the air, helping the male toads to attach them to their legs. Water eggs would also hatch earlier as smaller sized tadpoles, which nevertheless grew faster, becoming larger as adults than normal &#39;land&#39; toads. Yet another crucial experiment was described: If Kammerer scraped the eggs off the legs of normal land-breeding males, and then grew them in water, the resulting toads had normal, land-breeding behavior. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs Kammerer pointed out, this excluded the possibility that the changed breeding habits were merely the result of somatic phenotypic plasticity upon embryonic exposure to water. Rather, they required altered breeding conditions of parental, adult toads, conceivably modifying their germ cells.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe fact that parent-of-origin effects were not mentioned in previous discussions is a good example of how modern knowledge changes the focus on previously overlooked details.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Indeed, the possibility of an epigenetic mechanism for Kammerer’s experiments has stimulated a reexamination of Kammerer’s original papers in German (Gliboff, 2010; Svaardal, 2010), highlighting important new aspects. The parent-of-origin effects have now been confirmed with numerical detail of observed phenotypic frequencies (Gliboff, 2010). A very important fact that has finally made its way into the English literature is that most significant changes in the eggs did not occur over successive generations, but in successive breeding seasons of a single F0 parental generation that was kept in the heated room at 25–30°C (Svardal, 2010). Egg survival of the &#39;water eggs&#39; was low in the first breeding season (5–8%), but it increased with successive seasons, until it was equal to the 90% survival of normal eggs. The eggs also became increasingly numerous, smaller (with less yolk), and with thicker gelatinous coat.Water-breeding behavior (mating in water and lack of brood care) stabilized with successive breeding seasons spent in the heated room (Svardal, 2010), such that upon restoring normal temperatures (18°C), the toads would continue water breeding for a greater number of breeding seasons. Importantly, after some breeding seasons spent in the room, they would produce offspring with inherited water breeding, who presented this behavior under normal conditions. Inheritance would also stabilize increasingly, such that offspring from the later breeding seasons continued to display water-breeding behavior for a greater number of seasons at normal temperatures (18°C). Offspring from breeding season 5 and onwards displayed lifelong &#39;water&#39; reproductive behavior, and further inherited it equally stabilized to the next generation of toads. These descriptions point to increased behavioral stabilization and increasingly stable germ line modification, upon repeated breeding seasons spent under changed conditions, consistent with a largely epigenetic mechanism (Svardal, 2010).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eA relevant detail missing from Kammerer’s (’24) book was the conditions in which the eggs resulting from hybrid crosses were raised. It was previously proposed this could have been determined by the male’s instincts, with eggs being exposed to air when the male was a &#39;land&#39; toad, and water when the male was a &#39;water&#39; toad (Vargas, 2009). Since then, it has been clarified that the male followed the female into her preferred habitat, where copulation occurred (Gliboff, 2010; Svardal, 2010). In the case in which the male was a water-breeding toad and the female was a land-breeding toad, copulation occurred on land. Since water males did not carry the eggs (having lost their eggcaring instincts), the eggs remained abandoned on land, where they grew exposed to dry conditions. Thus, the land instincts of the female, rather than the male, determined the conditions in which these eggs (the F1 generation) would develop (Fig. 1). In the case where the male was a land-breeding toad and the female a water-breeding toad, copulation and egg laying occurred in water. However, the land-breeding male always hurried to pull the eggs ashore. The eggs, therefore, would grow exposed to dry conditions, as a result of the male’s preferences (Fig. 2). It has been argued that the male may have succeeded to bring the eggs onto land only in one replicate, but could have failed to do so in others (Gliboff, 2010). The other recent account provides no comment regarding the exposure of these eggs (Svardal, 2010). Clarifying this point is relevant, because the suggestion that these eggs were exposed to air (Vargas, 2009) has been presented by recent comments as a fundamental misunderstanding of Kammerer’s experiments. To assess this and other recent claims, one of us (Q. Krabichler) has investigated Kammerer’s original papers and translated the entire section of his 1911 paper about the crucial Mendelian hybrid crosses, which we provide as a supplementary document to this review (Supporting Information File 1). We are therefore able to contribute to the discussion with more relevant aspects of the experiments, as discussed in Kammerer’s original articles.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eNew Information On Kammerer’s Midwife Toad Experiments\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn Kammerer’s (’11) paper, a single replicate was fully described for each type of hybrid cross (water male with land female, land male with water female), while other replicates were only described in summary form since, as Kammerer explains, &#39;it won’t be necessary anymore to report on them in every detail&#39; (Kammerer, ’11, p. 104; see Supporting Information File 1). For the cross in which the male was a &#39;land&#39; toad, the summary of other replicates mentions some variations, but makes no mention of any failed attempts to bring the eggs on land. Nothing like this is mentioned elsewhere in the article, either, despite the fact that Kammerer would often comment on any abnormality, especially regarding breeding behavior. Thus, a straightforward understanding of Kammerer’s article is that these toads succeeded in bringing the eggs out of the water, and the F1 generation was exposed to air during embryonic development, as previously suggested (Vargas, 2009).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs mentioned above, in the hybrid cross with a &#39;land&#39; male, all F1 toads developed land-breeding habits. Kammerer crossed these F1 toads to obtain an F2 generation of eggs. This resulted in three-fourths of land-breeding toads and one-fourth of toads that had water-breeding instincts, despite all of them having spent their embryonic development exposed to dry conditions. This is consistent with another experiment by Kammerer. Upon taking the eggs from water-breeding toads and raising them on land, this resulted in toads that still presented water-breeding behavior (Kammerer, ’09, pp. 512–513; Kammerer, ‘10, pp. 18–19). As mentioned above, in a converse experiment, Kammerer took eggs from land-breeding toads and raised them in water, obtaining land-breeding behavior. Both experiments discard that breeding behavior could result from mere somatic plasticity during embryonic development. It is worth noting that, unlike breeding behavior, adult body size did show a direct response of somatic plasticity (Svardal, 2010). The eggs of water-breeding toads raised in dry conditions grew into normal-sized, waterbreeding toads, while the eggs of land-breeding toads raised in water resulted in large, land-breeding toads. From these large land-breeding toads, Kammerer bred yet another generation, this time under dry conditions, to check if the increased body size would be inherited. The result was a reversal to normal body sizes (Kammerer dismissed a slight trend to the upper range of normal size variation as &#39;too unclear&#39; Kammerer ’09, p. 501).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt has been argued recently that, through time, Kammerer provided partial and changing accounts of these experiments.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Allegedly, the &#39;controlling&#39; experiment mentioned above (where eggs of land toads were raised in water) was presented in early papers as a successful transformation by water by focusing on traits like body size. Kammerer would have then switched to presenting this experiment in his 1924 book as the inability of water exposure to change the inherited, land-breeding habits (Gliboff, 2010). \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe implication is that Kammerer would withhold crucial results, casting doubts over his scientific ethos. However, we found these claims to be unfounded. Kammerer had already reported the persistence of land-breeding habits in 1906, 1909, and 1913.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e In ’06, Kammerer had reported growing eggs of normal land toads on soil under humid conditions (daily bathing them in water), from which he obtained normal-sized toads with unaltered breeding behavior (Kammerer, ’09, p. 500 [referring to &quot;Experiment number 3&#39; from Kammerer, ‘06, p. 60 ff]). Moreover, in 1909 he reported similar results for eggs that were either kept on water-saturated soil or completely immersed in water (in the latter case, either taken from brood-caring toads and transferred into water or accidentally lost by brood-caring toads during a bath), obtaining toads with completely normal brood care behavior (Kammerer, ’09, p. 490 ff; p. 501 [referring to &#39;Experiments number 2 and 4&#39; from Kammerer, ’06, p. 58 ff and pp. 69 ff]). These &#39;controlling experiments&#39; (in Kammerer’s own words &#39;Kontrollversuche&#39;), which lead to unchanged breeding behavior, are once again mentioned directly in at least one other paper before 1924 (Kammerer, ’13, p. 161). In summary, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eKammerer always made it clear that a single embryonic exposure was insufficient to modify reproductive behavior, which required adult toads to spend repeated breeding seasons in the heated room.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt has also been argued that, according to Kammerer’s own views, temperature was the sole factor capable of inducing water-breeding and other heritable traits, whereas high or low humidity would determine only somatic effects (Svardal, 2010). In fact, Kammerer developed a more complex opinion, with a key role for behavioral plasticity. No factor by itself, either heat or humidity, could bring about the observed results.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Kammerer had set up another experiment with a heated room (25–30°C) where the water basin was removed either entirely or during the breeding season (Kammerer, ’09, p. 461 f.). In these conditions, the egg strings would dry too quickly and become rigid, but the toads would still attempt wrapping them around their legs, even wounding themselves. When Kammerer provided the toads with a wet patch of ground, this impeded the egg coat from drying, and toads could continue with successful landbreeding behavior, despite the high temperatures. These experiments prove that high temperature by itself was insufficient to make the toads abandon their land-breeding habits. The water basin was required to make a successful transition to water breeding. Additionally, Kammerer demonstrated that the same results of his main experiment (i.e., induction of water-breeding behavior) could be obtained if toads spent only breeding seasons under heated conditions, spending the rest of the year under normal, unheated conditions: the only effect was a delay reaching maturity (Kammerer, ’19, p. 329). This experiment demonstrated that neither water nor heat needed to be continuously present. Kammerer also reported yet another compelling experiment. Using toads that had already spent several breeding seasons in the heated room, he initiated a separate breeding line that was always kept under normal, nonheated conditions (Kammerer, ’09, p. 511 ff; Kammerer, ’19, p. 328). Inheritance of water breeding persisted unweakened in the next generations; this in itself is an impressive result because of the stabilization of inheritance. Furthermore, in this line, too, nuptial pads continued to become readily apparent from F3 generation onward, much like the line of toads that were kept constantly under heated conditions. This experiment demonstrated that nuptial pads would make their late appearance despite F1 and F2 generations having been spent in unheated conditions. Only the parental generation was exposed to high temperatures. Importantly, Kammerer reported that nuptial pads were inherited in true fashion, rather than being a merely somatic response. Thus, it is not straightforward to assume that heat alone was responsible for heritable effects. It may be necessary, but not sufficient. In Kammerer’s own words: &#39;Based on these (...) results, however, it can be concluded that in all breeding lines with ‘water eggs,‘ temperature may very possibly only have been the trigger, and not the factor which specifically determined the resulting changes. These in fact should secondarily result from the learning success: the morphological consequences and their inheritance only occur, once heat induction has changed the breeding behavior. The morphological phenomena are probably a result of the eggs being incubated in water instead of air; but the whole course of events -- initiated by the first step of relocating the reproductive instincts into water and depleting them of brood care behavior -- subsequently occurs due to the regime of humidity and density factors, and not anymore due to the temperature&#39; (Kammerer, ’19, p. 329).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTaken together, our reexamination of Kammerer’s original papers has revealed important new aspects, which other recent accounts had overlooked, despite providing many accurate details. Of course, we are aware that our own review is not the ultimate, decretory representation of Kammerer’s work, either. Instead, our effort is toward encouraging continued translation and research of Kammerer’s writings. No second-hand account, including this review, can be considered a substitute for hundreds of pages of original work.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eJudging Authenticity From Kammerer’s Descriptions: The Importance Of Parent-of-origin Effects\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe data that have entered current discussion, combined with a modern knowledge of epigenetics and inheritance, offer a renewed opportunity to judge the feasibility and authenticity of Kammerer’s results. An important part of doing this analysis properly is that, at least initially, we must take Kammerer’s descriptions at face value. This has been argued to be naïve (Gliboff, 2010), but if scientific analysis alone is to uncover any facts that are inconsistent or implausible, we cannot doubt any data from the outset based only on a historical mistrust of Kammerer.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the light of modern scientific knowledge, we can confidently state that Kammerer’s experiments do not contain any phenomenon that cannot be explained by currently known experiments and epigenetic mechanisms. This in itself provides a strong alternative to the traditional belief in fraud. On the other hand, the inheritance of acquired characteristics was a clearly desirable result for any neo-Lamarckian in the early 20th century. As such, the fact that Kammerer reported success in demonstrating this aspect would not specifically suggest authenticity. More dependable evidence, however, is provided by the presence of parent-of-origin effects, because in no way this was an expected or desirable outcome. It did nothing to strengthen any of the arguments of neo-Lamarckians in the early 20th century, who had no theoretical reasons to link these phenomena. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOnly in the late 20th century has it become clear how common mechanisms such as DNA methylation underlie parent-of-origin effects, genomic imprinting, and TEI. Experiments combining TEI and parent-of-origin effects have only been published in recent years. The presence of parent-of-origin effects is therefore the centerpiece argument for the authenticity of Kammerer’s midwife toad experiments (Vargas, 2009). Failure to properly acknowledge and discuss this point (as in Svardal, 2010) is a glaring omission, especially if we are to discuss the possibility of an epigenetic explanation.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTrue, But Irrelevant? Preepigenetic Judgments Of Kammerer’s Experiments\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhile the parent-of-origin effects now provide the first argument from the experiments themselves to support their authenticity, Koestler’s historical account of the events surrounding the fraud accusations had already managed to convince many of Kammerer’s potential innocence. However, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ea popular preepigenetic opinion was that even if the experiments were real, they were nothing truly out of the ordinary, even in Kammerer’s own time. In the late 20th century, this view was represented in a brief commentary about Koestler’s book penned by Gould (’72), the great paleontologist and science historian. Gould attributed the experimental results to a combination of somatic plasticity, selection, and conventional genetics.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e According to Gould:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;He took hundreds of eggs from females and tried to raise them in an unnatural aqueous environment. Only a few percent survived (pp. 155–156). He then repeated this procedure over several generations. In other words, in each generation he imposed a powerful selection for whatever genetic factors allow an egg to develop successfully in water. His final population differed markedly from natural ones in its progressive accumulation of genes conferring success in aqueous habitats. Is it then surprising that the nuptial pads -- an aqueous adaptation -- gained expression where they had before remained latent?&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn this view, Kammerer never truly deserved consideration as a groundbreaking scientist. It also allowed for comfort in the thought that, despite the sad outcome for Kammerer, true genius was not overlooked, nor was the progress of science slowed down. However, the reexamination of Kammerer’s descriptions has now revealed that the selective process described by Gould never took place.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Egg mortality decreased through environmental modification, within successive breeding seasons of a single generation (Svardal, 2010). Gould’s short commentary also shows no consideration of the controlling experiments, hybrid crosses, or parent-of-origin effects. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis suggests that, beyond relying on Koestler’s account, Gould did not investigate any of Kammerer’s own writings. In a similar vein, Baur, a contemporary of Kammerer, did not accuse him of fraud, but repeatedly argued the midwife toad experiments could be explained by mere somatic plasticity (e.g., Baur, ’11), even after Kammerer’s controlling experiments and hybrid crosses had been published. Kammerer duly denounced these inexplicable omissions (Kammerer, ’13, ’19, ’24).\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMore recently, it has been argued that Kammerer’s experiments were not extraordinary to his contemporaries, and that the fraud accusations were mostly a reaction to Kammerer’s hype and sloppiness (Gliboff, 2010). For instance, it has been pointed out that Kammerer’s contemporaries already knew about parent-of-origin effects, and thus could not have been impressed by the experiments (Gliboff, 2010). This is clearly a misunderstanding. Certainly, the parent-of-origin effects were not in themselves the most novel or controversial aspect and were mentioned as little more than a curiosity by Kammerer himself. They are more interesting to us nowadays‘ scientists, with the hindsight benefit of modern epigenetics, as a hint of authenticity in Kammerer’s experiments. At the time, what was most impressive was that a modified phenotype was being inherited according to Mendelian rules. Kammerer interpreted this as environmentally induced &#39;de novo&#39; formation of new alleles. It is disingenuous to argue that such a possibility would not have been considered radical. However, in modern perspective, Kammerer can hardly be blamed, since an epigenetically silenced gene can become functionally equivalent to a recessive allele, and without molecular tools, they cannot be told apart. Without knowledge of molecular epigenetics, the experiments were indeed hard to make sense of, which may have led to the fraud accusations (Vargas, 2009).\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMore realistically, Kammerer’s contemporaries offered a wide range of reactions, including acclamation, dismissal, and flatout denial.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e The challenging nature of Kammerer’s results did not go unnoticed to the influential William Bateson, creator of the word &#39;genetics&#39; and one of the main rediscoverers of Mendel’s laws. Bateson had a significant role in the fraud controversy, since he publicly doubted the reality of the nuptial pads in the famous journal Nature (Bateson, ’19, ’23), thus encouraging fraud accusations. Koestler incorrectly assumed that Bateson was a staunch neo-Darwinist, persecuting Kammerer for this reason (Koestler, ’71). In fact, Bateson (and other early Mendelians) openly questioned Darwinian gradualism, as well as the importance of natural selection (Bateson, 1894; Gould, 2002). Bateson had entirely different reasons to doubt the authenticity of Kammerer’s experiments, namely, the nature of the experiments themselves. This can be appreciated in a revealing commentary in Nature (Bateson, ’23) where he touches on Kammerer’s (’11) paper of Mendelian crosses:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;The discoveries claimed by Dr. Kammerer are many and extensive. To geneticists, that regarding heredity and segregation in Alytes ([Kammerer] ’11), which I called in question at the Linnean meeting is the most astounding. But what I then heard and saw strengthens me in the opinion expressed in 1913, that until this alleged observations of Brunftschwielen [Nuptial pads] in Alytes have been clearly demonstrated and confirmed, we are absolved from basing broad conclusions on his testimony.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eNote that Bateson speaks of Kammerer’s article on hybrid crosses of midwife toads as &#39;astounding&#39; to geneticists, and leading to &#39;broad conclusions.&#39; This suggests many geneticists indeed had problems with accepting the groundbreaking consequences, causing them to doubt the facts as reported (Vargas, 2009; Wagner, 2009). Importantly, during most of the 20th century, opinions often took a similar vein, alleging mechanistic impossibility to reinforce the fraud accusations. Take this commentary from 1975: &#39;[...] no biochemical mechanism (indeed, no system of any kind) has been forthcoming to explain how acquired characteristics change the genetic constitution [...].&#39; Even direct testing by repeating the experiments was discouraged, since &#39;no scientist should feel obligated to investigate a theory that does not meet his interests or give promise of forming the substrate for future investigation&#39; (Aronson, ’75). Given the advances of modern epigenetics, it is evident that such opinions have now been rendered utterly obsolete. However, we must keep in mind that this important shift has come about only recently.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Reappraisal Of Kammerer’s Potential Contribution\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn stark contrast with preepigenetic accounts of fraud or irrelevance, the midwife toad experiments, if authentic, would call for a reappraisal of Kammerer’s unfulfilled contribution to early studies of inheritance. Kammerer’s discoveries were indeed unique for his time. The midwife toad experiments combined environmental modification, Mendelian inheritance, and parent-of-origin effects, without any necessity of employing selection. Each phenomenon in isolation had certainly been reported, but experiments combining all three were a novelty, and in recent times, similar experiments have been considered important breakthroughs. It is also worth noting that, for a long time, phenomena like parent-of-origin effects were treated as exceptions to the norm rather than important components of inheritance, under the label of &#39;non-Mendelian genetics&#39; (West-Eberhard, 2003). During the mid-20th century, experiments that evoked the &#39;inheritance of acquired traits,&#39; such as many performed by Conrad Waddington, were considered within the boundaries of conventional genetics, especially because they require selection, which was viewed as playing the crucial role. No special mechanisms of inheritance were thought to be involved. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eTruly important implications have only been acknowledged recently, upon the uncovering of specific molecular mechanisms that respond to the environment, in experiments similar to those of the midwife toad, which do not require selection.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Perhaps Kammerer was able to make these discoveries because of his particular intellectual blend. He did not place much importance on selection (Kammerer, ’24) and combined the experimental principles of Lamarckism and Mendelism, two largely opposed schools at the time. These practices anticipated those of modern epigenetics. The effects of environmental modification are nowadays assessed in hybrid crosses through deviation from expected Mendelian frequencies. These may be good reasons to argue that Kammerer deserves consideration as an early forerunner to this field.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eProspects For New Experiments In The Midwife Toad\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDespite compelling signs of authenticity, only new experiments in the midwife toad can provide conclusive evidence for the authenticity of Kammerer’s reports. Beyond the important consequences for the history of biology, these experiments would also hold great potential for scientific advances. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eCurrently, the better-studied experiments in TEI deal with pathological phenotypes in laboratory rodents under largely artificial circumstances, such as exposure to pharmacological doses of environmental toxicants. It has long been assumed that the same epigenetic mechanisms should play a role in evolution, inducing and inheriting phenotypes upon naturally occurring environmental changes.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e In this regard, the midwife toad may provide an especially clear-cut opportunity to study TEI of adaptive traits and its evolutionary implications.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhile Kammerer’s contemporaries had reported being unable to breed the midwife toad in captivity (Koestler, ’71), during the 1980s, the Mallorcan midwife toad Alytes muletensis (a close relative with the same reproductive habits) was recovered from an almost extinct population in the wild, bred in captivity with great success, and reintroduced to its natural habitat, becoming a classic success story in conservation biology (Buley and Villavicencio, 2000). The Mallorcan midwife toad is small sized and has a fast reproductive cycle, and thus seems ideally suited to become a laboratory model species. The probabilities of success look promising. Evidence for epigenetic mechanisms in amphibians has been available for some time, such as different phenotypes of frogs cloned from different somatic cell types, due to different epigenetic modifications of the donor nuclei (King and Briggs, ‘56), which is consistent with the role of DNA methylation in amphibian development (for instance, see Yakushiji et al., 2007). Parent-of-origin effects in hybrid crosses of different toad species (Elinson, ’77) have now led to evidence of genomic imprinting in anurans (Michalak, 2014, 2015), against the commonplace notion that imprinting is only present in mammals and angiosperm plants.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eImportantly, the impressive body of work left behind by Ryuichi Matsuda (1920–1986) amply documented responses to environmental change in the developmental timing of amphibians (Hall et al., 2004), similar to what Kammerer reported in toads and salamanders. These responses are mediated by hormones and are often inherited transgenerationally, which is in agreement with the fact that endocrine disruptors initiate TEI in a variety of organisms (reviewed in Guerrero-Bosagna, 2015).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the light of modern knowledge, we offer a hypothetical model illustrating how epigenetic mechanisms could explain Kammerer’s results for breeding behavior, his main trait of analysis. We provide this model as a supplementary file to this review (Supporting Information File 2). Of course, with absolutely no molecular data, any model of specific mechanisms remains highly speculative. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOn the other hand, producing hypotheses with only partial information is a crucial part of the scientific process: confirmation or correction leads to advances.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e It is also important to clarify that the fact that we can propose a hypothetical model is far from producing actual proof of authenticity. Conversely, if upon rechecking Kammerer’s extensive descriptions we find some aspect of the model is wrong, this does not mean that the experiments are &#39;inexplicable&#39;, especially if the model is easily corrected. The truly crucial point is to replicate the experiments. If this is achieved, and the underlying mechanisms are unraveled, it is of little importance whether early hypothetical models were correct or not. At this point, the value of producing a hypothetical model is not to argue for or against authenticity, but to stimulate further research, not only of Kammerer’s extensive writings, but in experimental approaches, by providing a set of testable assumptions. Modern molecular tools would allow for quick assessment of epigenetic mechanisms, without the need of replicating the longer, transgenerational experiments of Kammerer. Within a single generation, the epigenomes of the germ cells of control versus treated individuals can be compared to assess for any difference in epigenetic markings. Also, the parent-of-origin effects described by Kammerer suggest that, asides from environmental conditions, paternal or maternal inheritance of alleles should be crucial for the epigenetic status of genes involved. We hope our hypothetical model is encouraging, since we believe our assumptions provide a convincing interpretation for several of Kammerer’s key experiments.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eConclusion: Moving Away From Cultural Warfare And Closer To Science\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eUntil this day, many biologists display knee-jerk reactions to any association with Lamarck or the &#39;inheritance of acquired traits.&#39; In contrast, during the early 20th century, many important researchers often referred to Lamarck in a positive light, having been labelled collectively as &#39;neo-Lamarckians.&#39; Of course, many have been quick to point out that most of these scientists, including Kammerer himself, presented important differences with Lamarck (Gliboff, 2006; Svardal, 2010; Burkhardt, 2013). This is hardly surprising, considering that Lamarck belonged to a past generation, when science altogether was a more metaphysical enterprise. And yet, their sympathy for Lamarck contrasts with the attitudes that ensued thereafter, where any effort to create distance from Lamarck was greatly rewarded. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWe may justly wonder how our scientific culture became so indoctrinated against anything reminiscing the man that paved the way for Darwin’s descent with modification, and coined the very term &#39;biology.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eDuring the mid-20th century, evolutionary science underwent what has been described as a &#39;dogmatic hardening,&#39; focusing excessively on natural selection (Gould, 2002). This period probably marked the peak of anti-Lamarckism. Certainly, several complex causes explain this turn, and it seems unlikely that Paul Kammerer alone could have changed the outcome. Even so, the incident may have played a more significant role than has been admitted so far. Kammerer was, after all, the most visible Lamarckian of the time. His research was often highlighted in the New York Times, who even described him in 1923 as being &#39;hailed as a second Darwin&#39; (Koestler, ’71). The case of fraud, whether true or not, may have done much to forward the rejection of anything Lamarckian. If Kammerer’s experiments had been accepted as authentic, we can rightfully wonder whether important facts of epigenetics could have made an earlier entrance to mainstream science. It has long been argued that social and cultural factors can condition the progress of science. An example is the slowness with which scientists came to agree upon the basic facts of syphilis disease (Fleck, ’35). The scientific progress of modern epigenetics may ultimately disclose the truth on the case of the midwife toad. However, the embarrassing fact remains that mainstream science spent more than half a century doubting the reality of any special mechanisms by which inheritance could be directly modified by the environment.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eEven today, we may still need closure regarding Kammerer. One could believe the incident happened so long ago that no one would any longer care, but Kammerer continues to draw unusual criticism. For instance, his retouching and colorization of photographs has been taken out of context to portray Kammerer as &#39;the father of photographic image manipulation&#39; (Weissman, 2010). In fairness, this practice was common at the time, when high-quality photographs were hard to achieve. It was properly disclosed by Kammerer and, much like scientific drawings (which continue to be used today), everybody understood that some faith had to be placed in their correspondence with actual specimens. The fact that even some of Kammerer’s contemporaries demanded better, unretouched photographs reveals the unusual suspicion and criticism placed on Kammerer, rarely afforded to other scientists of the time (Gliboff, 2006). Characterizations of Kammerer’s documentation as &#39;sloppy&#39; (Svardal, 2010) also strike us as unfair for a time in which basic modern tools (such as statistics or photography) were still in the making. The descriptions of modified organisms, which have been argued to be &#39;vague&#39; (Gliboff, 2006), are in our opinion satisfactory, providing explicit details and drawings, with special reference to any variation in experimental animals (morphological, behavioral, and larval). Despite claims to the contrary, the design and execution of the experiments were far from being faulty or ambiguous. They show a keen following of logical implications and great resourcefulness in addressing many variables.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOur impression is that Kammerer was a highly intelligent and very dedicated scientist and that most criticism has been facile and disproportionate. Indeed, one of the clearest achievements in Koestler’s anecdote-rich book was to document many unfair attacks flung against Kammerer. Scholars would therefore do well in taking this negative bias into account. In retrospect, the Kammerer episode may be attributed in no small degree to the unfortunate custom of attacking the individual, rather than discussing facts and ideas. Throughout the years, and even today, Kammerer has been called out for having strange beliefs, eugenics, scientifically wrong views, even womanizing, and &#39;amateur musicianship&#39; (Weissman, 2010). We find that Kammerer’s compositions are beautiful (readers may listen to &#39;Paul Kammerer Songs&#39; in the &#39;Darwin Nach Noten&#39; CD released in 2009), but his quality as a composer is quite beyond the point. We do not intend to prove that Kammerer was an infallible or exemplary human being: we only wish to establish whether his experiments could have been authentic. It would be easy to assemble a long list of eminent researchers from the 20th century with questionable beliefs and behaviors, but their scientific contributions cannot be placed in question on this basis. Editors of scientific journals often demand that authors maintain an impersonal discussion of facts and ideas, but even today, articles on Kammerer can take the lowbrow form of cultural warfare, focused on discrediting perceived &#39;enemies&#39; and their motivations, rather than discussing the experiments and their feasibility.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn summary, a near century of bad publicity and anecdotes have been unable to close the case surrounding Kammerer’s midwife toad experiments. Compared to most previous debate, modern epigenetics offers a refreshingly scientific approach. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHistorians interested in discussing the authenticity of the experiments may have to move out of their comfort zone and become updated on the continued advances of epigenetics. In any case, an end to the controversy can only come from renewed experimentation on the midwife toad. It is safe to say that Kammerer’s fate now lies fully in the lap of epigenetics. Only researchers in this field can perform these conclusive experiments and decide whether Kammerer deserves a reappraisal.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAcknowledgments\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSpecial thanks to Jorge Mpodozis, who teaches the undergrad course of evolution at the University of Chile, and taught A.O.V. and C.G.-B. about &#39;Lamarckian experiments,&#39; Waddington, and other topics that are often left out.

Now, with the ubiquity of the internet and the rise of machine learning, a new kind of solution is beginning to take shape. The infrastructure of the web, built to link one resource to the next, was the beginning. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe next wave of information systems promises to more deeply establish links between people, ideas, and artifacts that have, so far, remained out of reach -- by drawing connections between information and objects that have come unmoored from context and history.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Controversy-First Approach Starts with the Controversy Card\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen we are grappling with some new idea -- or some idea that we are new to -- we need a broad survey of the reasons to believe.  Accordingly, the selection of the first stories we read on a subject should seek to provide a basic overview. Because people shouldn&#39;t be expected to commit at this stage, it should also be short.  The focus should be at the level of concepts, a review of the history, or the source of the controversy -- whatever mix of those elements serves to pique interest.  No different than telling a joke, the sequence matters.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eModeled after a baseball card, the controversy card approach strives to do just that.  Although as information architects, we can never accurately know every context that a person is coming from, each controversy or critique of modern science has its main points.  Readers want to know those upfront -- which is the reason why the summary appears prominently -- and oftentimes just as large as the graphic.  Since people may be quickly scanning many such cards, this text is carefully compressed to its smallest possible unit -- but not at the expense of dropping out crucial information.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eSince controversies tend to require more than 100 words to explain, they are oftentimes followed by text.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen we hear an hour-long talk on some subject, there are two competing approaches to questions -- interject or save them for the end.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMy hope with the controversy card approach has been to redesign our interactions with scientific controversies by inverting the learning process from the in-the-weeds specialist textbook approach which will predictably lose most readers, to a broad, inclusive generalist approach which gets straight to the point.  The question with each controversy is: How quickly can I get this person to understand the debate?\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eBut, the idea has never been to stop there.  The card itself does not satisfy all of our needs.  If we are, for example, filling out a large taxonomy for some obscure topic, it&#39;s intended as a conceptual anchor point, from which the detail of the controversy map fills in.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eTraditionally, software developers have force-fitted their data into relational tables: this key associates with this value, and a bunch of these key-value pairs belong in this here table.  Although most problems can be shoe-horned into that single approach, the graph database is the more appropriate solution when the relationships between the key-value pairs are just as important as the relationship of the key to the value.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eGraph Databases\u003c/i\u003e, by Ian Robinson, Jim Webber, and Emil Eifrem\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&quot;Graph databases address one of the great macroscopic business trends of today: leveraging complex and dynamic relationships in highly connected data to generate insight and competitive advantage.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Whether we want to understand relationships between customers, elements in a telephone or data center network, entertainment producers and consumers, or genes and proteins, the ability to understand and analyze vast graphs of highly connected data will be key in determining which companies outperform their competitors over the coming decade.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFor data of any significant size or value, graph databases are the best way to represent and query connected data. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eConnected data is data whose interpretation and value requires us first to understand the ways in which its constituent elements are related.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e More often than not, to generate this understanding, we need to name and qualify the connections between things ...\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis increased focus on graph databases is driven by twin forces: by the massive commercial success of companies such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter, all of whom have centered their business models around their own proprietary graph technologies; and by the introduction of general-purpose graph databases into the technology landscape.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eWhen people visit a social network, their interest will tend to root in something that is happening \u003cb\u003etoday\u003c/b\u003e; I&#39;m talking about the ubiquitous \u003cb\u003esocial network feed\u003c/b\u003e.

After observing laypeople interact with controversies for years now on various social media, it&#39;s apparent that most of these conversations never break through the superficial layer that science journalists leave them at.

Those annotations then act much like ant trails which others can subsequently follow into the network graph. From those annotation roots, lines extend outwards: Some are tagged with rebuttals.

And the gold was to be found everywhere -- at least in any well-equipped laboratory. The two scientists were Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe apparatus was simple enough (see figure 3.1): a beaker of heavy water (like ordinary water but with the hydrogen atoms replaced by &#39;heavy hydrogen&#39;, otherwise known as deuterium); a palladium &#39;electrode&#39; known as the cathode, and a platinum electrode, known as the anode. A small amount of the &#39;salt&#39;, lithium-deuteroxide, was added to the heavy water to serve as a conductor. Though these substances are not in everyday use, and are rather expensive, they are quite familiar to any modern scientist; there is nothing exotic about the apparatus. Put a low voltage across this &#39;cell&#39; for a period of up to several hundred hours, and out should come the gold: fusion power. The heavy hydrogen atoms should fuse together into helium, releasing energy; this is the way the sun is powered. The telltale signs of fusion were heat and nuclear byproducts such as neutrons -- sub-atomic particles -- and traces of the super-heavy hydrogen atom, tritium.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePons and Fleischmann added an intriguing tease to the account of their success. They warned that the experiment was only to be attempted on a small scale. An earlier cell had mysteriously exploded vaporising the palladium and producing a large hole in the concrete floor of the laboratory. Luckily it had happened during the night and no-one was hurt.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe experiment seemed straightforward and there were plenty of scientists willing to try it. Many did. It was wonderful to have a simple laboratory experiment on fusion to try after the decades of embarrassing attempts to control hot fusion. This effort required multi-billion dollar machines whose every success seemed to be capped with an unanticipated failure. &#39;Cold fusion&#39; seemed to provide, as Martin Fleischmann said during the course of that famous Utah press conference, &#39;another route&#39; -- the route of little science.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eScientists the world over immediately started scrambling for information about the experiment. Details were hard to come by. Faxes, electronic mail networks, newspapers and television all played a role. Some scientists did not wait for details. That same night enterprising students at MIT started the first attempted replications based on a video of a television news programme on which the apparatus had briefly been shown. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSuch experiments had little chance of success because the exact conditions employed by Pons and Fleischmann were not yet known.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e ... cold fusion experiments were to suffer from their apparent simplicity -- at least in the early days before scientists recognised just how complicated a palladium-deuterium electrolytic cell could be. Within a week a photocopied manuscript showing the technical details of the experiment became available. Now replication started with a vengeance. Scarce supplies of palladium were bought up and pieces of equipment were scavenged from everywhere. Many stayed up all night nursing their electrolytic cells. Science had seen nothing like it; neither had the world&#39;s press which ran continuous news items and updates of progress. It was &#39;science by press conference&#39; as scientists queued up to announce their latest findings and predictions to the media.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnd for a while it looked as if cold fusion was real. Amazingly, in the week following the first announcement it became clear that there was not just one Utah cold fusion group, but two. The second independent group was located at nearby Brigham Young University and they too had been getting positive results for the previous three years. This group, headed by physicist Steven Jones, had not found excess heat, but had detected neutrons from a cold fusion cell (although at a much lower level than claimed by Pons and Fleischmann). Both groups had submitted their results to the prestigious scientific journal Nature.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTexas A&amp;M University soon announced to the waiting media that they too were seeing excess heat from a cold fusion cell, and then came an announcement from Georgia Tech that they were seeing neutrons. Positive results were reported from Hungary and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Rumours of positive results came in from all over the scientific world. The Japanese were supposed to be launching their own massive detection programme.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePatents had been filed on behalf of Pons and Fleischmann by the University of Utah. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIndeed part of the reason for the press release before the results were published in a scientific paper (a breach of scientific etiquette which was to be held against the scientists) was the University of Utah&#39;s concern to ensure priority over the nearby group at Brigham Young University.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Utah seemed set to become the Gold Rush State with the State Legislature meeting and voting $5 million towards the cold fusion effort. Congress was approached for a possible further $25 million. Even President Bush was being kept appraised of developments.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut then doubts started to surface. It transpired that Georgia Tech had made a mistake; their neutron detector turned out to be heat sensitive. The Texas A&amp;M excess heat measurements were explained away by an improperly earthed temperature sensitive device. Groups at MIT and national laboratories such as Lawrence Livermore and Oak Ridge were not yet seeing anything. Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s paper was mysteriously withdrawn from Nature. Congress decided to put the $25 million on hold.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAt the American Physical Society meeting that May in Baltimore, with the ever-present media circus in attendance, criticism reached a crescendo. An MIT group claimed that Pons and Fleischmann had incorrectly interpreted their evidence for neutrons; a prestigious California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) group reported detailed replication attempts, all negative, and cast doubt upon the correctness of the Utah measurements of excess heat; and finally a Cal Tech theorist pronounced that cold fusion was extremely improbable theoretically and accused Pons and Fleischmann of delusion and incompetence. The University of Utah pair were not at the meeting to defend themselves, but Steven Jones from the other Utah cold fusion group was there. Unfortunately for Pons and Fleischmann, even Jones distanced himself from their work, claiming that he too had doubts about the measurements of excess heat.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFor most of the gathered community of physicists, already sceptical about whether chemists could overturn cherished assumptions about fusion physics, enough was enough. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eGold became fool&#39;s gold, or that at least is how the story goes. As we shall see, like most of the episodes examined in this book, there is more to be said; much more.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe little science route to fusion\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOne can chart the rise and decline of cold fusion from the price of palladium. On 23 March 1989, just before the announcement of the discovery, the price was $145.60 an ounce. By May 1989 at the height of the cold fusion frenzy the price had risen to $170.00 an ounce. Prices plummeted following the Baltimore APS meeting. As of today (October 1992) the price has fallen back to $95.00 an ounce.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt is palladium, or rather one property of palladium, which provided the impetus to the search for cold fusion. It is known that palladium has a surprising ability to absorb vast quantities of hydrogen. If a piece of palladium is &#39;charged&#39; with as much hydrogen as it can absorb, then the pressure inside the crystal lattice dramatically increases. Perhaps at such high pressures the normal barrier of positive charge (known as the Coulomb barrier) preventing nuclei coming together to fuse could be overcome. It was a long-shot but scientists before Pons and Fleischmann had actually tried to produce fusion between hydrogen nuclei this way.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the 1920s, soon after the discovery of the atomic structure of matter, two German chemists working at the University of Berlin attempted to produce fusion of hydrogen using palladium. Fritz Paneth and Kurt Peters were not interested in fusion as a source of energy but in the product, helium, which was used in airships. New ways to make helium were urgently sought by German industry because the USA, the main commercial supplier, refused to sell helium to Germany after the First World War. Paneth and Peters, knowing of palladium&#39;s affinity for hydrogen, set up an experiment in which they passed hydrogen over red-hot palladium. They claimed to detect the presence of small amounts of helium. Unfortunately they later discovered that the probable source of the helium was gas already absorbed in the glass walls of their apparatus. However, their work was taken up another scientist and inventor: John T andberg, a Swede who worked at the Electrolux Corporation Laboratory in Stockholm.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTandberg had remarkably similar ideas to those of Pons and Fleischmann 60 years later, or so it seems with hindsight. In 1927 he had applied for a patent for a device to manufacture helium by the electrolysis of water with a palladium cathode. In his device hydrogen produced at the cathode entered the palladium lattice and there, with the huge pressures induced by absorption, underwent fusion to produce helium. That at least was the claim. The only substantial difference between Tandberg&#39;s device and the later set-up of Pons and Fleischmann was the use of light water as the electrolyte. Tandberg&#39;s patent was rejected because the description was said to be too sketchy. However, after the discovery of deuterium (in the 1930s) Tandberg pursued the work further by attempting to create fusion in a wire of palladium which had been saturated with deuterium by electrolysis. It seems he met with little success, at least in regard to the production of helium.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePons and Fleischmann were unaware of the earlier work when they started their experiments in 1984. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMartin Fleischmann is one of Britain&#39;s most distinguished electrochemists.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Stanley Pons (an American), visited the University of Southampton to study for his PhD in 1975 and that is where the two met. Fleischmann, who was Faraday Professor of Electrochemistry at Southampton, had a reputation for being the sort of scientist who liked to carry out high-risk science, pursuing bold and innovative ideas and approaches. Indeed he had built his career with such work and some of the risks had paid off. Fleischmann had made a number of important discoveries, as recognised by his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1986.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe reason for Fleischmann being in Utah in 1989 had to do with British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. The Thatcher cutbacks of funding to British universities in 1983 meant that Fleischmann was forced to take early retirement from the University of Southampton (where he retained an un-paid position). He became a freelance researcher teaming up with Pons who was by now a productive scientist in his own right, and chair of the University of Utah Chemistry Department. Pons was aged 46 and Fleischmann 62 when the discovery was announced. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ePons, too, had a reputation for successful high-risk science. Pons and Fleischmann were well aware that cold fusion was a long-shot. They initially funded experiments with $100,000 of their own money, expecting to see at most tiny traces of tritium and perhaps some neutrons. The levels of excess heat they detected were a complete surprise.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eJones&#39; involvement\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe announcement of 23 March 1989 cannot be understood without reference to the work of the other Utah group, led by Steven Jones at Brigham Young University. While the scientific community were unfamiliar with Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s work on cold fusion, they had been following Jones&#39; progress for several years. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn 1982 Jones and his colleagues had undertaken a major experimental effort looking for fusion triggered by sub-atomic particles produced at the Los Alamos particle accelerator. They had found far more evidence of such fusions than theory would have led them to expect, but not enough to make a source of viable energy. Like hot fusion research, particle-induced fusion was a frustrating step a way from the excess energy output needed for commercial exploitation.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eJones had moved on to consider how very high pressures might encourage hydrogen isotopes to fuse. The key breakthrough in his thinking came in 1985 when Brigham Young geophysicist Paul Palmer drew his attention to the anomaly of excess heavy helium (helium-three) found near volcanoes. Palmer and Jones thought this could be explained by deuterium contained in ordinary water undergoing geologically induced cold fusion inside the earth.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Brigham Young group pursued the idea, attempting to reproduce the geological processes in the laboratory. They were searching for a metal, traces of which in rock might serve as a catalyst for fusion. They built an electrolytic cell essentially similar to that of Tandberg and tried various materials for the electrodes. Soon they too decided that palladium, with its ability to absorb hydrogen, was the most likely candidate. The group built a low-level neutron detector to measure any fusion which was occurring. In 1986 they started to observe neutrons at a rate just above background levels. By 1988, using an improved detector, they felt confident that they had found definite evidence of neutron production.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eJones had carried out this research unaware of the similar efforts being carried out at the nearby University of Utah. He first heard of Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s experiments in September 1988 when he was sent their research proposal to referee by the Department of Energy (Pons and Fleischmann had at last decided that their work merited funding from public sources).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt was unfortunate for both groups that such similar work was being pursued in such close proximity. In view of the obvious commercial payoff which might result from cold fusion and the need for patent protection it meant that a certain amount of rivalry and suspicion arose between the two groups. Exactly what they agreed regarding the joint publication of their results is still disputed.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt seems that in early 1989 Pons and Fleischmann were hoping that Jones would hold off from publishing for a period (up to eighteen months), giving time for them to refine their measurements. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ePons and Fleischmann were, it appears, confident that they were seeing excess heat, but had no firm evidence for its nuclear origins. Some crude measurements indicated that neutrons were coming out, but more exact measurements were desirable. Fleischmann even tried to arrange to have a cold fusion cell flown out to the Harwell Laboratory in England where he was a consultant and where very sensitive neutron detectors were available. Unfortunately the cell was declared a radiation risk and could not be taken across international boundaries. In the event Pons and Fleischmann claimed they could indirectly detect neutrons by observing interactions in a water shield surrounding the cell. It was these hastily carried out measurements which were later to be challenged by the MIT group; they turned out to be the Achilles heel in the Utah body.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePons and Fleischmann were under pressure from Jones&#39; impending announcement. Although Jones cancelled one seminar in March, he planned to announce his results at the meeting of the American Ph ysical Society on 1 May. Pons and Fleischmann, in order not to lose their priority claim, reached an agreement with Jones to dispatch separate papers from both groups to Nature on 24 March.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn March, however, communication between the two groups broke down. Although Jones was going to speak in May his abstract was made public beforehand. Pons and Fleischmann, it seems, took this as licence to go public themselves. Also, the University of Utah group were worried that Jones might be stealing their ideas on excess heat, having had access to their work via the Department of Energy research proposal. A further complicating factor was a request in March to Pons from the editor of the Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry for a paper on his latest work. Pons quickly wrote up an account of the cold fusion experiments which he submitted to the journal. It was this paper (published in April 1989), which would eventually be widely circulated, and provided the first technical details of the experiments.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eUnder growing pressure from the Utah administration, Pons and Fleischmann decided to go ahead with a press conference on 23 March, the day before the planned joint submission to Nature. A leak from Fleischmann to a British journalist meant that the first report of the discovery appeared in the British Financial Times on the morning of 23 March. Thus the world&#39;s press were primed to descend on Utah. At the press conference no mention was made of the other Utah group.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eJones, who was by now infuriated by both the press conference and the revelation that a paper had already been submitted, considered the agreement to have been broken and immediately dispatched his own paper to Nature. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eNothing could be more symbolic of the miscommunication which had arisen between the two Utah groups than the lone figure of Marvin Hawkins (a graduate student who worked with Pons and Fleischmann), waiting at the Federal Express office at Salt Lake City Airport at the appointed hour on 24 March for someone from Jones&#39; group to appear. No-one arrived and the Pons and Fleischmann paper was mailed alone.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe controversy\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt was Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s results that gave rise to the cold fusion controversy. The levels of neutrons detected by Jones were of lower orders of magnitude and he has never claimed to observe excess heat. Jones&#39; results also did not pose the same theoretical challenge. Furthermore, Jones, unlike Pons and Fleischmann, made a point of playing down the commercial application angle.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe detrimental effect on the credibility of scientists&#39; findings when they get caught up in a scientific controversy not of their own choosing is revealed by the reception of Jones&#39; results. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eGiven his previously established reputation in the field, the minimal theoretical consequences his results posed, and the modest manner in which he presented them, if it had not been for Pons and Fleischmann, Steve Jones would probably have quietly established an interesting fact about the natural world: fusion of small amounts of deuterium in palladium metal.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDespite his attempts to distance himself from the other Utah group, Jones has inevitably been subject to the same suspicions. The reality of his neutron measurements has come into question, and there is no consensus as to whether he has observed fusion.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ePons and Fleischmann, unlike Jones, had no established reputation in the field of fusion research; they were chemists not physicists. Moreover they were claiming something which to most physicists was theoretically impossible. Not only did it seem extremely unlikely that fusion could be occurring, but also, if all the heat excess was caused by fusion, then the levels of neutrons produced should have been more than enough to have killed Pons and Fleischmann and anyone else who happened to be in the close proximity of one of their cells. In short, fusion could not occur and, if it did, then they should be dead. This is what one might refer to as a &#39;knockdown&#39; argument!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThere is little doubt that when fusion researchers heard the news on 25 March they were sceptical. The reaction was:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;Suppose you were designing jet airplanes and then you suddenly heard on CBS news that somebody had invented an antigravity machine.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e (Quoted in Mallove, 1991, p. 41).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnother remarked at the time:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;I&#39;m willing to be open-minded, but it&#39;s really inconceivable that there&#39;s anything there.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e (Ibid., p. 41).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ePart of the scepticism came from fusion researchers being only too familiar with grandiose claims for breakthroughs which shortly afterwards turn out to be incorrect. There had been many such episodes in the history of the field and thus fusion scientists were wary of extravagant claims.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e For them, solving the world&#39;s energy problems via a breakthrough in fusion had about as much chance of being true as the perennial claims to have superseded Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThough fusion researchers, well-used to spectacular claims, and with their own billion-dollar research programs to protect, were incredulous, other scientists were more willing to take the work seriously. Pons and Fleischmann have fared better with their colleagues in chemistry where, after all, they were acknowledged experts. Early on Pons presented his findings to a meeting of the American Chemical Society where he was given a rapturous reception.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e For most, the prejudices of the scientific community probably mattered less than the fact that the experiment seemed easy to perform. If there was anything to it, most scientists reckoned, then all should soon become clear. Pons and Fleischmann had two sorts of evidence to back up their claims: excess heat and nuclear products. These had to be tested.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eExcess heat\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTesting for excess heat was in essence no more than a high-school physics problem. A careful account of the power input and output of the cell was kept, including all the known chemical reactions that are capable of transforming chemical energy into heat. This accounting needs to be carried out over a period of time because at any one moment the books might not balance as energy might get stored in the cell (turning it into a heat bank, as one might say). It is a fairly straightforward procedure to establish the power output by measuring the temperature rise, the cell first having been calibrated using a heater of known power. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn practice the experiment took some time to perform because the palladium electrodes had to be fully charged with deuterium (for 8 mm diameter electrodes this could take several months).\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe heat excess varied between cells. Some cells showed no heat excess at all. The power sometimes came in surges; in one case four times as much power was recorded coming out as went in. However, more routinely the heat excess was between 10% and 25%.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDespite the capricious nature of the phenomenon, Pons and Fleischmann were confident that the heat excess could not be explained by any known chemical process or reaction.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eNuclear products\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe most direct proof of fusion would be the production of neutrons correlated with the excess heat. The first neutron measurements attempted by Pons and Fleischmann were relatively crude.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e The output from a cell was compared with the background as measured at a distance of 50 metres from the cell. A signal three times the background was claimed to be recorded for this one cell. This was a suggestive result, but as neither the energy of the neutrons was known, nor whether the background was the same close to the cell as at 50 metres distance, it was far from conclusive. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eA more satisfactory procedure was to measure the gamma-ray bursts produced by neutrons captured by protons in the water bath surrounding the cell. These measurements were made over a two-day period by Bob Hoffman, a Utah radiologist. The numbers of neutrons detected, if any, were billions less than would be expected if all the heat was produced by the deuterium fusion reaction.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnother piece of evidence for fusion having taken place would be the presence of its products, such as tritium. Pons and Fleischmann found traces of tritium in the palladium cathode of one cell. The difficulty with this finding -- a problem which has beset all the claims -- is that tritium is a known contaminant of heavy water.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eReplication\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs mentioned already, after the announcement on 23 March attempts to repeat the experiments followed fast and furious. Although they got much media attention, these early results (both positive and negative) counted for little. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe embarrassment caused by the premature announcements from Georgia Tech and Texas A&amp;M cautioned those scientists who were seriously trying to repeat the experiment that they faced a long struggle. Many were taken in by the seeming ease of the experiment only to discover that a palladium electrolytic cell was a deal more complicated than expected.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ePart of the difficulty facing scientists trying to repeat the experiment was that Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s account of what they had done was insufficiently detailed.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e There was discussion of the exact size of the electrodes to be used, the current densities at which to operate the cells, whether the lithium salt was crucial or could be substituted by another salt, whether the cathode was &#39;poisoned&#39; and with what, and for how long the experiment should run. None of these were clear. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eFollowing on from their initial announcement, Pons and Fleischmann were inundated with requests for information. In the frenetic atmosphere at Utah it is no wonder that scientists did not always find it easy to get the crucial information.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eSome have accused Pons and Fleischmann of deliberate secrecy in order to secure patent rights or (later on, when many became disillusioned) to hide their own incompetence. However, given the commercial importance of the discovery, securing the patent rights is no small matter; it is routine in areas of biotechnology. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAlso it seems that Pons and Fleischmann were initially hesitant because of their own uncertainties and their fears about the dangers of the experiment. They were also worried about creating a cheap source of tritium, since tritium is one of the crucial ingredients of a hydrogen bomb.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe elusive details of the experiments were soon spreading through an informal network of electronic mail and telephone contacts. Indeed, electronic mail may have been important in this controversy in producing the rapid consensus against cold fusion which developed after the Baltimore American Physical Society meeting. For instance, Douglas Morrison, a CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research) physicist and early enthusiast of cold fusion, set up an electronic newsletter which seems to have been widely read. Morrison soon became sceptical of the claims and referred scientists to Irving Langmuir&#39;s notorious talk on &#39;pathological science&#39;, where a number of cases of controversial phenomena (including N-Rays and ESP) in science were dismissed as a product of mass delusion. (Langmuir&#39;s talk was reproduced in Physics Today in October 1989.) Cold fusion was, according to Morrison, the most recent case of pathological science.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat became clear early on was that, while most groups saw nothing, a few had positive results. The classic problem of replication during a scientific controversy was surfacing. Negative results could be explained away by the believers as being due to differences in the replicating experiment. To those who failed to find anything, however, this was simply confirmation that there was nothing to be found. Fleischmann and Pons&#39;s own attitude, as expressed in their testimony to Congress in April 1989, was that they were not surprised by the negative results as many cells were being set up with incorrect parameters and dimensions.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOf the early positive replications reported, one of the most important came from Robert Huggins, a materials scientist at Stanford University. Huggins had run two cells, one with ordinary water and one with heavy water, and found that only the heavy water cell produced excess heat. This answered a long-running criticism of Pons and Fleischmann for not setting up a &#39;control&#39; cell with ordinary water. Huggins has consistently found positive results over the years.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnother criticism of the Pons and Fleischmann work was that the cells they used were open cells from which the gases produced in electrolysis (deuterium and oxygen) could escape. The worry here was whether the energy balance was affected by the possible chemical recombination of deuterium and oxygen to form heavy water, thereby adding heat to the system. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis objection was finally overcome when John Appleby of Texas A&amp;M (not the same Texas A&amp;M group which prematurely announced positive results) performed closely controlled calorimetry experiments using closed cells. Heat excesses were again found.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOf the negative results, one of the most influential came from a Cal Tech group headed by chemist Nathan Lewis and phvsicist Charlie Barnes. The Cal Tech team had tried a variety of combinations of conditions and had found nothing. As mentioned already, Lewis reported the negative results to the Baltimore American Physical Society meeting to dramatic effect. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHis results had extra impact since he implied that Pons and Fleischmann were guilty of an elementary oversight. They had neglected to stir the electrolyte thus allowing hot spots to develop and produce spurious temperature readings.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHowever, it seems that Lewis&#39; charges were misplaced. Pons and Fleischmann claimed that there was no need to stir the electrolyte because the deuterium bubbles produced by the reaction did the job sufficiently well.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e In order to demonstrate the error Lewis had tried to make an exact copy of Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s cell. He had taken as his source a photograph of a cell in the Los Angeles Times. It turns out that this cell was only used by Pons and Fleischmann for demonstration purposes and was of much larger dimensions than the cells used in actual experimental runs. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ePons and Fleischmann were later able to demonstrate with a simple experiment placing a few drops of dye in the electrolyte that the bubbles acted as an adequate stirring mechanism.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs in other controversies what was taken by most people to be a &#39;knockdown&#39; negative result turns out, on closer examination, to be itself subject to the same kinds of ambiguities as the results it claims to demolish. If Lewis&#39; measurements had been unpacked in the same kind of detail reserved for Pons and Fleischmann they might not have seemed as compelling as they did at the time. In the atmosphere of the Baltimore meeting, where physicists were baying for the blood of the two chemists, and where a whole series of pieces of negative evidence was presented (see below), Lewis was able to deliver the knock-out blow.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe classic problem of replication has surfaced with another set of highly influential negative findings, those reported by Harwell. As a result of Fleischmann&#39;s contact with Harwell, David Williams, an ex-graduate student of Fleischmann&#39;s, actually started his experiments before the March announcement. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe results obtained to all intents and purposes killed off cold fusion in Britain. Again on the face of it the experiments look impressive with a number of cells being checked for excess heat and neutrons over lengthy periods.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe results, however, are not compelling for proponents of cold fusion such as Eugene Mallove, who claim that almost half the cells were run at currents below the threshold for cell activity. Other criticisms have been made of the Harwell methods of heat estimation. Despite the differing interpretations of the Harwell experiment, for many scientists it was the best word on cold fusion.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAs well as attempts to replicate the phenomenon by setting up electrolytic cells, new experiments have searched for cold fusion by other methods. One such is cooling and reheating the palladium so that it becomes supersaturated with deuterium. Bursts of neutrons have been detected in such experiments.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe difficulty which the proponents face in getting positive results accepted is well illustrated by the fate of the tritium measurements. It will be recalled that Pons and Fleischmann had themselves found traces of tritium. More evidence came from other experimenters, including a group in India with a long history of making tritium measurements, a group at Los Alamos and a third group at Texas A&amp;M University. However, since tritium is a known contaminant of heavy water there is a ready-made &#39;normal&#39; explanation for all such results. It has proved to be impossible to satisfy the critics that no contamination has occurred, because they can always think of ways in which tritium might get into the cell\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt has even been suggested that the affair has involved fraud. In 1990, an article in the journal Science puts forward fraud as a factor in the Texas A&amp;M tritium measurements. The impasse between proponents and critics, an impasse made worse by each side accusing the other of &#39;unscientific&#39; behaviour, is typical of scientific controversies. The critics cite a preponderance of negative results as grounds to dismiss the controversial phenomenon and any residual positive results are explained away as incompetence, delusion or even fraud. The proponents, on the other hand, account for the negative results as having arisen from the failure to reproduce exactly the same conditions as used to obtain positive results. Experiments alone do not seem capable of settling the issue.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eCold fusion: a theoretical impossibility?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMost of the debate has been fought out against a background in which cold fusion has been held to be impossible on theoretical grounds. Although Pons and Fleischmann, like Tandberg beforehand, hoped that the extreme pressures inside the palladium lattice would help enhance fusion of deuterium, there was little theoretical justification that this would be the case.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOne of the responses of nuclear physicists to the cold fusion claims has been a detailed re-examination of the theoretical possibilities. Steve Koonin and Mike Nauenberg have devoted considerable time and energy to this problem. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAlthough in reworking the calculations they discovered errors which increased the rate of deuterium-deuterium fusion by a factor of over 10 billion compared with earlier calculations, the main thrust of his work has been to show why deuterium fusion in palladium in the amount needed to produce excess heat is extremely unlikely. Koonin and Nauenberg have pointed out that the increased pressure inside palladium was not enough to bring about fusion. Indeed, in a palladium lattice the deuterium nuclei would actually be further apart than in ordinary heavy water. Their calculations for the likelihood of deuterium-deuterium fusion showed that the rate would be extremely slow. In a telling comparison Koonin described it this way: &#39;A mass of cold deuterium the size of the Sun would undergo one fusion per year.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThus Koonin, in reviewing all the theoretical possibilities at the May meeting of the American Physical Society, was able to make theoretical justifications seem preposterous. As Koonin told a New York Times reporter: &#39;It is all very well to theorize about how cold fusion in a palladium cathode might take place ... one could also theorize about how pigs would behave if they had wings. But pigs don&#39;t have wings!&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e (quoted in Mallove, 1991, p. 143).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn a context where the experimental evidence was fast vanishing it was little wonder that most physicists were happy to go along with the accepted wisdom.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThere is no doubt that Koonin represents the standard view. As is typical for a scientific controversy where experiment seems to go against prevailing theory, however, there is more to say than this. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIndeed throughout the cold fusion episode a number of suggestions have been made as to how fusion might occur on the necessary scale and furthermore how it might occur without neutrons being produced.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Some of the more serious suggestions have come from physics Nobel Laureate Julian Schwinger and the MIT laser physicist who helped invent the X-ray laser, Peter Hagelstein. One idea has been to think of ways whereby a rare neutronless fusion reaction could be the source of the excess heat, with energy being transferred into the palladium lattice. Hagelstein, drawing upon ideas in laser physics, has also proposed &#39;coherent fusion&#39;, whereby chains of fusion reactions occur in a kind of domino effect.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWith the experimental results under a cloud, most theorists see little reason to entertain such exotic ideas. One is reminded of the solar-neutrino case\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e (see chapter 7), where many speculative theories were produced to explain the discrepancy between standard theory and the experimental results. Even though the discrepancy there was only a matter of a factor of 3 none of the alternative theories gained widespread acceptance. It seems unlikely that, in a case where the discrepancy is a factor of 57 orders of magnitude (10 with 56 0s after it) and where the experimental results have much less credibility, conventional theory is going to be over-thrown. There is no doubt that Hagelstein himself takes these alternative theories very seriously -- he has even applied for patents for devices based upon his theories. The risks in pursuing such theories beyond the mere &#39;what if&#39; stage (i.e. treating such theories as serious candidates rather than mere speculations) are well illustrated by the Hagelstein case: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethere have been persistent rumours that his tenure at MIT was in jeopardy after he started to produce theoretical explanations of cold fusion.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eCredibility\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe struggle between proponents and critics in a scientific controversy is always a struggle for credibility. When scientists make claims which are literally &#39;incredible&#39;, as in the cold fusion case, they face an uphill struggle. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe problem Pons and Fleischmann had to overcome was that they had credibility as electrochemists but not as nuclear physicists. And it was nuclear physics where their work was likely to have its main impact.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAny claim to observe fusion (especially made in such an immodest and public manner), was bound to tread upon the toes of the nuclear physicists and fusion physicists who had already laid claim to the area. A vast amount of money, expertise, and equipment had already been invested in hot fusion programs and it would be naive to think that this did not affect in some way the reception accorded Pons and Fleischmann.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis is not to say that the fusion physicists simply rejected the claims out of hand \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e(although a few did)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, or that it was a merely a matter of wanting to maintain billion-dollar investments \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e(although with the Department of Energy threatening to transfer hot fusion funding to cold fusion research there was a direct threat to their interests)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, or that this was a matter of the blind prejudice of physicists over chemists (although some individuals may have been so prejudiced); \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eit was simply that no scientists could hope to challenge such a powerfully established group without having his or her own credibility put on the line. As might be expected, the challenge to Pons and Fleischmann has been most acute in the area where the physicists feel most at home, the area of the neutron measurements.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eNeutron measurements\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFor many physicists it was the neutron measurements which provided the best evidence for fusion. Yet paradoxically these measurements formed the weakest link in Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s claims. As we have seen, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ethe measurements were carried out belatedly and under pressure from others. Worse, neither Pons nor Fleischmann had any special expertise in such measurements.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt was at Harwell, at a seminar given by Fleischmann shortly after the March announcement, that the first inkling of difficulties was to arise. Fleischmann presented the evidence of neutrons and showed a graph of the gamma-ray peak obtained by Hoffman from the water shield. To physicists in the audience who were familiar with such spectra, the peak looked to be at the wrong energy. The peak was at 2.5 MeV whereas the expected peak for gamma-rays produced by neutrons from deuterium should have been at 2.2 MeV. It looked as if something had gone awry with the calibration of the gamma-ray detector, but it was impossible to tell for certain because Fleischmann did not have the raw data with him and had not made the measurements himself. In any event by the time the graph appeared in the ]ournal of Electroanalytical Chemistry the peak was given at the correct value of 2 .2 MeV.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhether the two versions arose from &#39;fudging&#39; or genuine errors and doubt over what had been measured is unclear. Frank Close, in his much publicised sceptical book about the cold fusion controversy, Too Hot To Handle, suggests that the graph was deliberately doctored -- a charge taken up by science journalist William Broad in an article in the New York Times, of 17 March 1991. Such accusations should, however, be treated with caution. Close, in particular, falls into the trap of exposing all the gory detail of the proponents&#39; experiments, leaving the critics&#39; experiments to appear as clear-cut and decisive. Such a one-sided narrative merely serves to reaffirm the critics&#39; victory.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe neutron measurements soon came under further scrutiny. Richard Petrasso, of the MIT Plasma Fusion Center, also noticed that the shape of the gamma-ray peak looked wrong. The difficulty in taking this observation further was that Pons and Fleischmann had not yet released their background gamma-ray spectrum. What the MIT scientists did was to pull off something of a scientific scoop. They obtained a video of a news programme which showed the inside of Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s laboratory including a VDU display of their gamma-ray spectrum. Petrasso concluded that the claimed peak could not exist at 2.2 MeV and that furthermore it was impossible to see such a slim peak with the particular instrument used. The absence of a Compton edge also eliminated the peak as a viable candidate for neutron capture. The conclusion of the MIT group was that the peak was &#39;probably an instrumental artefact with no relation to gamma-ray interactions&#39;.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ePreliminary reports of the work were given by Petrasso at the Baltimore meeting to maximum rhetorical effect. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn tandem with the Cal Tech negative results they were to have the decisive impact\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e on the course of the controversy which we have already charted.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe criticism of the neutron measurements was eventually published in Nature along with a reply from Pons and Fleischmann. Although they made much of MIT&#39;s resort to a news video as a source of scientific evidence (pointing out that what had been referred to by Petrasso as a &#39;curious structure&#39; was none other than an electronic cursor and denying that the video had shown a real measurement), the Utah pair were now placed on the defensive. They published their full spectrum showing no peak at 2.2 MeV but claiming evidence for a new peak at 2.496 MeV. Although they could not explain this peak in terms of a known deuterium fusion process they maintained the peak was produced by radiation from the cell. In an ingenious move they tried to turn Petrasso&#39;s argument around by saying that if indeed their instrument was not capable of detecting such peaks then the lack of a peak at 2.2 MeV should not in itself be taken as evidence against fusion. MIT replied in turn claiming that the peak at 2.496 MeV was actually at 2.8 MeV.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMany scientists have taken this episode as showing that the main argument in favour of fusion had collapsed. However, another interpretation is possible. This is that the best evidence for cold fusion always came from the excess heat measurements -- the experimenters&#39; own strength. The hastily performed nuclear measurements had always been puzzling because too few neutrons were observed. In trying to &#39;come clean&#39; on the difficulties of interpreting their nuclear measurements Pons and Fleischmann were attempting to draw attention back to the main thrust of their argument -- the excess heat measurements. Indeed, when Pons and Fleischmann finally published their full results in July 1990, the paper was almost entirely about calorimetry -- no nuclear measurements were reported.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe trouble was that for many physicists the nuclear data were what had got them excited in the first place and the weakness of the neutron evidence left the excess heat measurements as mere anomalies, possibly of chemical origin. Furthermore, the problems over the nuclear measurements could easily be taken to demonstrate Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s incompetence as experimenters. Despite the Utah pair being widely acknowledged as experts in electrochemistry, this kind of &#39;guilt by association&#39; seems to have paid off for the critics and has helped discredit the experiment as a whole.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eConclusion\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the cold fusion controversy the stakes were very high and the normally hidden working of science has been exposed. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe cold fusion episode is often taken to show that there is something wrong with modern science. It is said that scientists claimed too much, based on too little, and in front of too many people. Press review is said to have replaced peer review. False hopes of a new age of limitless energy were raised, only to be dashed.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eSuch an interpretation is unfortunate. Pons and Fleischmann appear to have been no more greedy or publicity seeking than any prudent scientists would be who think they have on their hands a major discovery with a massive commercial payoff. The securing of patents and the fanfare of press conferences are inescapable parts of modern science, where institutional recognition and funding are ever more important. There is no turning the clock back to some mythical Golden Age when scientists were all true gentlemen (they never were anyway, as history of science has taught us in recent years). In cold fusion we find science as normal. It is our image of science which needs changing, not the way science is conducted.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23coldfusion\"\u003e#coldfusion\u003c/a\u003e     \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23energy\"\u003e#energy\u003c/a\u003e   \ufeff",

Mills, announced at a press conference in Lancaster, Pa., that he had devised a theory in which the electron in hydrogen could transition from its normal ground energy state to previously unknown lower and more stable states, liberating copious amount of energy in the process. Mills named this curious new type of shrunken hydrogen the hydrino, and he has been at work ever since to develop a commercial device to harness its power and make it available to the world.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWilk has studied Mills’s theory, read Mills’s papers and patents, and carried out his own calculations on the hydrino.

It all got started in 1989, when electrochemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons made the stunning announcement at a press conference at the University of Utah that they had tamed the power of nuclear fusion in an electrolysis cell.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhen the researchers applied a current to the cell, they thought deuterium atoms from heavy water that had penetrated into the palladium cathode were fusing to form helium atoms. The excess energy from the process dissipated as heat. Fleischmann and Pons said this process could not be caused by any known chemical reaction, and the nuclear reaction term &#39;cold fusion&#39; was attached to it.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAfter months of investigating Fleischmann and Pons’s puzzling observations, however, the scientific community came to a consensus that the effect was inconsistent or nonexistent and that the scientists had made experimental errors. The research was summarily condemned, and cold fusion became a synonym for junk science.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eCold fusion and making hydrinos both hold the holy-grail promise of generating endless amounts of cheap, pollution-free energy. Scientists were frustrated by cold fusion. They wanted to believe it, but their collective wisdom told them it was all wrong. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ePart of the problem was they had no generally accepted theory to guide them and explain the proposed phenomenon\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e -- as physicists like to say, no experiment should be believed until it has been confirmed by theory.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eMills has his own theory, but many scientists don’t believe it and think the hydrino improbable. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe research community has stopped short of the public dismissal it gave cold fusion and has tended to just ignore Mills and his work.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Mills has reciprocated by trying to stay out from under the shadow of cold fusion.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the meantime, the field of cold fusion was rebranded as low-energy nuclear reactions, or LENR, and survives. Some scientists continue to try to explain the Fleischmann-Pons effect.

The NASA team wrote in a report that the results &#39;fall far short of being compelling&#39; and did not mention anything about hydrinos.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe researchers offered possible electrochemical processes that might explain the heat, including irregularities in the electrochemical cell, possible unknown exothermic chemical reactions, or the recombination of split-apart hydrogen and oxygen atoms of water. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThese are the same arguments made by scientific critics of the Fleischmann-Pons experiments. However, the NASA team did say that researchers should leave the door open, just in case Mills really was on to something.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eMills is a mile-a-minute talker who can go on forever spilling out technical details. Besides predicting the hydrino, Mills says his theory can perfectly predict the location of every electron in a molecule using his bespoke Millsian molecular modeling software, even in molecules as complex as DNA. With standard quantum theory, scientists struggle to predict the exact behavior of anything much more complex than a hydrogen atom. Mills further says his theory also explains why the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, something cosmologists have yet to fully wrap their arms around.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eMills also says hydrinos are created from burning hydrogen in stars such as our sun and are evident in the spectral lines of starlight. Hydrogen is recognized as the most abundant element in our universe, but Mills goes further to claim that hydrinos are the missing dark matter in the universe. Those proposals come as a bit of a surprise to astrophysicists: &#39;I have never heard of a hydrino,&#39; says the University of Chicago’s Edward W. (Rocky) Kolb, an expert on the dark universe.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eMills has reported isolating hydrinos and characterizing them using standard spectroscopic methods such as infrared, Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition, he says hydrinos can react in the way hydrogen might to form new types of compounds &#39;with amazing properties.&#39; These include conductive materials that Mills says would revolutionize electronic devices and batteries.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eEven though popular opinion is against him, Mills’s ideas seem less far-fetched when compared with other unusual components of the universe. For example, a muonium is a known, short-lived exotic entity made of an antimuon particle (a positive, electronlike particle) and an electron. Chemically, muonium behaves like a hydrogen isotope, but it’s nine times as light as hydrogen.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eTHE HYDRINO SUNCELL\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eNo matter where hydrinos fit in on the scale of believability, Mills told C&amp;EN a decade ago that BLP had moved past the scientific verification stage and was interested only in discussing commercial applications. Over the years, BLP has collected more than $110 million from investors to see what it can do.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eBLP’s approach to creating hydrinos has taken on different manifestations over time. In an early prototype, Mills and his R&amp;D team used tungsten or nickel electrodes with a lithium or potassium electrolyte solution. An applied electric current splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen, and under the right conditions, lithium or potassium then acts as a catalyst to absorb energy and collapse hydrogen’s electron orbit. The energy released in going from the ground atomic state to a lower energy state comes off as a brilliant emission of light in a high-temperature plasma. The associated heat is then captured to create steam to power an electric generator.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eBLP is currently testing a device called the SunCell in which hydrogen (from splitting water) and an oxide catalyst are introduced into a spherical carbon reactor along with dual streams of molten silver. An electric current applied to the silver ignites a hydrino-forming plasma reaction. Energy from the reaction is then trapped by the carbon, which acts as a &#39;blackbody radiator.&#39; When the carbon heats up to thousands of degrees, it reemits the energy as visible light that is captured by photovoltaic cells, which convert the light to electricity.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhen it comes to commercial development, Mills at times comes off looking paranoid and at other times like a shrewd businessman. Mills has trademarked &#39;Hydrino.&#39; And because his issued patents claim the hydrino as an invention, BLP asserts that it owns all intellectual property rights involving hydrino research. BLP therefore forbids outside experimentalists from doing even the most basic hydrino research, which could confirm or deny hydrinos, without first signing an IP agreement. &#39;We welcome research partners; we want to get others involved,&#39; Mills says. &#39;But we do need to protect our technology.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eMills instead has commissioned validators who say they can corroborate that BLP’s inventions work. One of the validators is Bucknell University electrical engineering professor Peter M. Jansson, who is paid for his evaluations of BLP technology through his consulting company, Integrated Systems. Jansson says that being compensated for his time &#39;does not in any way cloud my judgment as an independent investigator of scientific discoveries.&#39; He adds that he debunks most &#39;new discoveries&#39; he checks out.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;BLP scientists are doing real science, and to date, I have found no errors in their scientific methods or approaches,&#39; Jansson says. &#39;Over the years, I have witnessed many BLP devices clearly capable of creating excess energy at meaningful levels. I think it may take some period of time for the scientific community to absorb, digest, and accept the possibility of lower energy states of hydrogen. I think Dr. Mills has made a compelling case.&#39; Jansson adds that commercial viability remains a challenge for BLP, but the way forward is being held up by business issues, not scientific ones.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eMeanwhile, BLP has hosted several demonstrations of its latest prototypes for investors since 2014, posting videos on its website after the fact. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut these events do not provide clear evidence one way or the other as to whether the SunCell is legitimate.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn July, after one recent demonstration, the company announced that the anticipated cost of operating the SunCell is so low -- about 1 to 10% of that for any other existing form of power -- that the company &#39;intends to provide autonomous individual power for essentially all stationary and motive applications untethered to the grid or any fuels infrastructure.&#39; In other words, the company plans to build and then lease SunCells or other devices to customers and charge a per diem usage fee, allowing people to go off the power grid and stop buying gasoline or diesel while paying just a fraction of what those things now cost.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;This is the end of the age of fire, the internal combustion engine, and centralized power and fuels,&#39; Mills says. &#39;Our technology is going to make all other energy technology obsolete.

In 2011, Rossi and his colleagues announced at a press conference in Bologna, Italy, that they had built a tabletop reactor, called the Energy Catalyzer, or E-Cat, that produces excess energy via a nickel-catalyzed process.

The short-lived beryllium decays into two α-particles with the excess energy given off as heat; some of the nickel is reported to turn into copper. Rossi says no waste is created in the process, and no radiation is detected outside the apparatus.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eRossi’s announcement initially gave many scientists the same queasy feeling as did cold fusion. One reason many people are having trouble believing Rossi is his checkered past. In Italy, he was convicted of white-collar criminal charges related to his earlier business ventures. Rossi says those convictions are behind him and he no longer wants to talk about them. He also once had a contract to make heat-generating devices for the U.S. Army. But the delivered devices did not work according to specifications.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn 2012, Rossi announced completion of a 1-MW system that could be used to heat or power large buildings.

In 2015, Cherokee Chief Executive Officer Tom Darden, who trained as an environmental scientist and a lawyer, described Industrial Heat as &#39;a funding source for LENR inventors.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDarden said Cherokee started Industrial Heat because the investment firm believed that LENR technology was worth pursuing. &#39;We were willing to be wrong.

Yet, at the time, Nagel also said he thought LENR devices would be offered for sale by 2013.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eRossi continues his research and has announced development of other prototypes. But he gives away few details about what he is doing. Rossi tells C&amp;EN that the industrial 1-MW plants are in construction already and he has obtained the &#39;necessary certifications&#39; for selling the systems. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe household devices are still waiting for safety certification\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e, he notes.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eNagel says now that the excitement from Rossi’s initial announcement has died down, the LENR status quo has returned. The likely availability of commercial LENR generators is now at least a few years away, Nagel says.

It hasn’t been easy for them because, for years, their papers have been returned unreviewed from mainstream journals and their abstracts for talks at scientific conferences have tended to go unaccepted. They are becoming more anxious about the status of the field because they are running out of time -- whether to secure their legacy in scientific history if LENR proves correct or just to have peace of mind in knowing their instincts haven’t failed them.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;It was unfortunate that cold fusion was initially publicized in 1989 as a new fusion energy source instead of simply as a new scientific curiosity,&#39; says electrochemist Melvin H.

Not all start-up companies, even ones with sound technology, are successful for reasons that are not scientific in nature: capitalization, cash flow, cost, manufacturing, insurance, and competitive energy pricing, to name a few.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFor example, consider Sun Catalytix. The company spun off from MIT is one example of a start-up built on strong science that fell victim to commercial pressures before it hit its stride. The company was created to commercialize an artificial photosynthesis process developed by chemist Daniel G. Nocera, now at Harvard, to economically and efficiently convert water into hydrogen fuel with sunlight and inexpensive catalysts.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eNocera envisioned that hydrogen generated in this way could power a simple fuel cell to provide energy to homes and villages in poor regions of the world without access to a power grid, making modern conveniences available and improving quality of life. But the process needed significantly more capital and more time to develop than the company initially thought. After four years, Sun Catalytix abandoned its commercialization effort, turned to making flow batteries, and then was bought in 2014 by Lockheed Martin. Sun Catalytix no longer exists.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt’s unclear whether the companies pursuing LENR and related technologies have stuttered primarily because of similar business hurdles. For example, Wilk, the organic chemist who has been following Mills’s progress, is becoming a little bit obsessed trying to sort out if BLP’s commercialization efforts are based on something real or make-believe. He simply wants to know, does the hydrino exist?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn 2014, Wilk asked Mills if he had ever isolated hydrinos, and although Mills had previously written in research papers and patents that he had, Mills replied that he hadn’t and that it would be &#39;a really, really huge task.&#39; But Wilk doesn’t see it that way. If the process generates liters of hydrino gas as he has calculated, it should be obvious. &#39;Show us the hydrino!&#39; Wilk pleads.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWilk says Mills’s world, and by extension the world of others involved in LENR, reminds him of one of Zeno’s paradoxes, which suggests that motion is an illusion. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;Every year they make up half the remaining distance to commercialization, but will they ever get there?&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Wilk can think of four possible explanations for BLP: Mills’s science is actually right, it’s a complete fraud, it’s just simply bad science, or it’s what Chemistry Nobel Laureate Irving Langmuir called pathological science.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eLangmuir coined the term more than 50 years ago to describe a psychological process in which scientists unconsciously veer away from the scientific method and become so engrossed in what they are doing they develop an inability to be objective and see what is real and not real. Pathological science is &#39;the science of things that aren’t so,&#39; Langmuir said. In some cases, it is embodied in areas of research like cold fusion/LENR that simply will not go away, even when given up on as false by a majority of scientists.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;I hope they’re right,&#39; Wilk says about Mills and BLP. &#39;I really do. I’m not out to debunk them, just to get at the truth.&#39; For the sake of the argument—&#39;if pigs could fly,&#39; as Wilk puts it, he says he’ll accept their data, their theory, and other predictions that can be derived from them. But he has never been a true believer. &#39;I think if hydrinos existed, they would have been detected by others in laboratories or in nature years ago and would be used by now.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAll the discussions about cold fusion and LENR end that way: They always come back to the fact that no one has a commercial device on the market yet, and none of the prototypes seem workable on a commercial scale in the near future.

So, too, is &#39;How likely is it that this drug will be approved by the FDA?&#39; Questions to which there may not be a single right answer, but to which some answers are certainly better than others -- such as, &#39;What would be the best place to build this new public swimming pool?&#39; -- are cognition problems, too.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe second kind of problem is what&#39;s usually called a \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ecoordination problem\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eCoordination problems require members of a group (market, subway riders, college students looking for a party) to figure out how to coordinate their behavior with each other, knowing that everyone else is trying to do the same.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e How do buyers and sellers find each other and trade at a fair price?

First, in most of them the members of the group were not talking to each other or working on a problem together. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThey were making individual guesses, which were aggregated and then averaged\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e ... it is likely to produce excellent results ... Second, the group&#39;s guess will not be better than that of every single person in the group each time. In many (perhaps most) cases, there will be a few people who do better than the group. This is, in some sense, a good thing, since especially in situations where there is an incentive for doing well (like, say, the stock market) it gives people reason to keep participating. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut there is no evidence in these studies that certain people consistently outperform the group. In other words, if you run ten different jelly-bean-counting experiments, it&#39;s likely that each time one or two students will out-perform the group. But they will not be the same students each time. Over the ten experiments, the group&#39;s performance will almost certainly be the best possible. The simplest way to get reliably good answers is just to ask the group each time.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Coordination Problem:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&quot;What defines a coordination problem is that to solve it, a person has to think not only about what he believes the right answer is but also about what other people think the right answer is. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnd that&#39;s because what each person does affects and depends on what everyone else will do, and vice versa.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOne obvious way of coordinating people&#39;s actions is via authority or coercion. An army goose-stepping in a parade is, after all, very well-coordinated. So, too, are the movements of workers on an old-fashioned assembly line. But in a liberal society, authority (which includes laws or formal rules) has only limited reach over the dealings of private citizens, and that seems to be how most Americans like it. As a result many coordination problems require bottom-up, not top-down, solutions. And at the heart of all of them is the same question: \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHow can people voluntarily -- that is, without anyone telling them what to do -- make their actions fit together in an efficient and orderly way?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt&#39;s a question without an easy answer, though this does not mean that no answer exists. What is true is that \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ecoordination problems are less amenable to clear, definitive solutions\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e than are many of the problems we&#39;ve already considered. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnswers, when they can be found, are often good rather than optimal. And those answers also often involve institutions, norms, and history, factors that both shape a crowd&#39;s behavior and are also shaped by it. When it comes to coordination problems, independent decision making (that is, decision making which doesn&#39;t take the opinions of others into account) is pointless -- since what I&#39;m willing to do depends on what I think you&#39;re going to do, and vice versa. As a result, there&#39;s no guarantee that groups will come up with smart solutions. What&#39;s striking, though, is just how often they do.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e[...]\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&quot;Bees are remarkably efficient at finding food. According to Thomas Seeley, author of The Wisdom of the Hive, a typical bee colony can search six or more kilometers from the hive, and if there is a flower patch within two kilometers of the hive, the bees have a better-than-half chance of finding it. How do the bees do this? They don&#39;t sit around and have a collective discussion about where foragers should go. Instead, the hive sends out a host of scout bees to search the surrounding area. When a scout bee has found a nectar source that seems strong, he comes back and does a waggle dance, the intensity of which is shaped, in some way, by the excellence of the nectar supply at the site. The waggle dance attracts other forager bees, which follow the first forager, while foragers who have found less-good sites attract fewer followers and, in some cases, eventually abandon their sites entirely. The result is that bee foragers end up distributing themselves across different nectar sources in an almost perfect fashion, meaning that they get as much food as possible relative to the time and energy they put into searching. It is a collectively brilliant solution to the colony&#39;s food problem.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat&#39;s important, though, is the way the colony gets to that collectively intelligent solution. It does not get there by first rationally considering all the alternatives and then determining an ideal foraging pattern. It can&#39;t do this, because it doesn&#39;t have any idea what the possible alternatives -- that is, where the different flower patches -- are. So instead, it sends out scouts in many different directions and trusts that at least one of them will find the best patch, return, and do a good dance so that the hive will know where the food source is.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis is, it&#39;s important to see, different from the kind of problem solving that we looked at earlier. In the case of the ox-weighing experiment, or the location of the Scorpion, or the betting markets, or the IEM, the group&#39;s job was to decide among already defined choices or to solve a well-defined problem. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn those cases, different members of the group could bring different pieces of information to bear on a problem, but the set of possible solutions was already, in a sense, determined.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e (Bush or Kerry would become president; the Ravens or the Patriots would win the Super Bowl.) In the case of problems like finding the most nectar-rich flower patches, though, the task is more complicated. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt becomes a twofold process. First, uncover the possible alternatives. Then decide among them.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the first stage of this process, the list of possible solutions is so long that the smart thing to do is to send out as many scout bees as possible.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e You can think of Ransom Olds and Henry Ford and the countless would-be automakers who tried and failed, then, as foragers. They discovered (in this case, by inventing) the sources of nectar -- the gasoline-powered car, mass production, the moving assembly line -- and then asked the crowd to render its verdict. You might even see Olds&#39;s publicity stunts as a kind of equivalent to the waggle dance.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eOne key to this approach is a system that encourages, and funds, speculative ideas even though they have only slim possibilities of success. Even more important, though, is diversity -- not in a sociological sense, but rather in a conceptual and cognitive sense. You want diversity among the entrepreneurs who are coming up with the ideas, so you end up with meaningful differences among those ideas rather than minor variations on the same concept. But you also want diversity among the people who have the money, too. If one virtue of a decentralized economy is that it diffuses decision-making power (at least on a small scale) throughout the system, that virtue becomes meaningless if all the people with power are alike (or if, as we&#39;ll see in the next chapter, they become alike through imitation). The more similar they are, the more similar the ideas they appreciate will be, and so the set of new products and concepts the rest of us see will be smaller than possible. By contrast, if they are diverse, the chances that at least someone will take a gamble on a radical or unlikely idea obviously increases.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe Cooperation Problem:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&quot;Cooperation problems often look something like coordination problems, because in both cases a good solution requires people to take into account what everyone else is doing. But if the mechanism is right, coordination problems can be solved even if each individual is single-mindedly pursuing his self-interest -- in fact, in the case of price, that&#39;s what coordination seems to require. To solve cooperation problems -- which include things like keeping the sidewalk free of snow, paying taxes, and curbing pollution -- the members of a group or a society need to do more. They need to adopt a broader definition of self-interest than the myopic one that maximizing profits in the short term demands. And they need to be able to trust those around them, because in the absence of trust the pursuit of myopic self-interest is the only strategy that makes sense.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e How does this happen?
